Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43mjo9/wp_you_possess_the_ability_of_persistent_lucid/)\n\nIt went from a terrible five part miniseries, to a Wattpad hopeful, to nothing as I lost motivation and drowned in work through the years, until finally I straightened myself out and rewrote the whole manuscript starting last year.\n\nAnd now, somehow, here we are.\n\nI'm both humbled and proud to present *Lost in a Dream*, a novel that actually adheres pretty closely to the prompt even after all of the rewriting and deep edits. Here is the blurb from the rear cover:\n\n>**If dreaming is a drug, then I'm a junkie.**  \n>  \n>For most people, sleeping is an obstacle. Something to get out of the way, so they can get back to their life. For others, it's an escape to nothing; a blissful break from the wears of life.  \n>  \n>It's the opposite for me.  \n>  \n>I live so that I can dream. I trudge through work so that I can go home and close my eyes, awakening in the real world\u2014one where dreams do come true. A place where I can fight a dragon instead of my ever-disappointed boss, where I\u2019m a warrior instead of a glorified telemarketer. A place where I matter.  \n>  \n>Tigers instead of taxes. Monsters instead of men with too much power.  \n>  \n>Reality is just the word we came up with to accept a mundane life. A birthing place for grander ideas we so desperately wish could come true.  \n>  \n>I choose to live in a world where they do.\n\nI\u2019ll also share a few quick bits about the book:\n\n*Lost in a Dream* is a lovechild of literary fiction and fantasy; it's likely considered portal fantasy, but leans more toward the literary side thematically.\n\n* The cover art was done by Flor Figueroa over at Fiverr - look into her work if you want awesome minimalist cover art!\n* The novel is a shred under 74,000 words, so it's not a book you can club people with. Sorry.\n* It is a standalone novel--there won't be a sequel. I do, however, already have my next books planned.\n* *Lost in a Dream* is my first published work!\n\nHere's a snippet from the **advanced praise** for *Lost in a Dream:*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I picked it up and just couldn't put it down.  \n>  \n>*\u2014 Man with glue hands*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you are interested in reading** ***Lost in a Dream***, **then please visit you relevant Amazon marketplace:**\n\n**Paperback:**\n\n[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173567480X) | [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/173567480X) | [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/173567480X) | [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/173567480X) | [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/173567480X) | [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/173567480X) | [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/173567480X) | [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/173567480X)\n\n**E-book/Kindle:**\n\n[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [NL](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [BR](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [MX](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [IN](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08HKV1KNB)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of right now, there is no hardcover--I couldn't get it prepared in time for my desired launch date.

Chances are you\u2019re more so than me, at the least, but that\u2019s not much of a feat. Rather, we are each little universes of thought, infinite in expanse yet bound by flesh; pioneers lost in our own minds. Every human is a wellspring of possibility and impossibility, every breath a wish for something greater as we run desperate from the impending dark.\n\nWe are, in a sense, prisoners to ourselves. Slaves to dreams we may well never grab hold of, working to the bone so that one day the schism between what we want and what we have might narrow ever so slightly. It is no surprise that every night we shut down for a brief reprieve, where we get a taste of the strange workings inside our heads. A glimpse into the potential we each have, raw as it may be.\n\nWhen we aren\u2019t asleep, exploring our own dreams, we look to those of others. Snippets of what it\u2019s like to live in someone else\u2019s mind; pretty portals to vast, new, and often beautiful worlds, or ones so terrible and forlorn that anything seems tolerable when compared. Something\u2014anything\u2014to distract from the one that we\u2019re in. To feel greater than ourselves.\n\nAfter all . . . isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here?\n\n# ~ ~ ~\n\n*Is it greed to desire something grand?*\n\nI often asked myself things like that as I killed someone.\n\nMany lives have been forever reduced to similar questions that fade in and out like fireflies on a dark summer night\u2014what\u2019s ironic is that putting a sword through a neck is so much easier than finding the answers. It shouldn\u2019t be, right? Just reach out and grab one of the little lightbugs and put it in a jar to study later . . . but every time I try, they vanish. All I get is a fistful of darkness.\n\nBy the time I was done thinking about all of that, there was only one other person breathing in the field before me: the man who had killed my family. My friends. My clansmen. I\u2019d have cried looking at him if that well hadn\u2019t dried up so long before; screamed if there were any leftover rage to burn.\n\n\"You're strong, Kinghunter,\" Ilhor Drago snarled, a hulking man in shimmering ebony armor patterned with wispy typhoons of cream and oxblood. He must\u2019ve stood seven feet tall. \"But this is my home, and I'll not die here like some flame you'd snuff out with a shovel of dirt.\"\n\nHe peered at me through two clusters of holes in a solid iron headpiece, describable only as a perforated bucket. The rest of his battalion littered the wood-lined meadow like smashed tin cans. They'd made quite a morbid medium for my art, shades of death tainting the lush, fertile forest around us, painting fern and flower slick with a contrasting crimson. In the holy glow of spring's sun, amidst a field paint-brushed with trampled fuchsia tulips and peonies that dribbled out of the treeline, the bloodied plants almost looked at home.\n\nIlhor charged at me, and I backpedaled toward the lake's muddy shore while keeping my sword raised overhead. Ilhor would be a challenge, no doubt\u2014perhaps even worth three whole questions\u2014but challenges are meant to be overcome, even if that challenge was once the most feared knight in any kingdom. A man known for cleaving children in two might terrify most, but I\u2019d have fought God himself if that\u2019s what it would\u2019ve taken to put an end to Hadrian\u2019s reign.\n\n*What will I do when all of this is over?*\n\nHis footwork was perfectly placed with excellent tempo; he had the speed of a fox despite swelling with brutish strength, bowing the boundaries of human limits as if they physically couldn't contain his mass. Each swing of his enormous weapon left my own feeling heavier and heavier in hand, every metallic crack a seismic spasm that rang my soul like a church bell. I ducked and weaved through his razing, slowly backstepping to dodge; parrying had become too taxing on my aching palms. With each lurch forward, he churned huge piles of mud, flinging it around us. Though he was slowed, the length of his broadsword kept me from making a clean retreat.\n\n*Is there a place left in the world for someone like me?*\n\nNot only was I reduced to defense, but the stout cascade of steel he donned had virtually no openings, aside from under the armpits and a small gap beneath his helmet\u2014one just big enough to slip a thin, thirsty blade into.\n\nAnother swing, another step, retreating further and further until I could avoid parrying no more and our swords locked with spark and screech. He grabbed me with a single hand that touched its fingers together at the nape of my neck, feet desperately reaching for the ground as he lifted me into the air. I must've looked to pedal myself airborne.\n\n*Why am I so damn good at this?*\n\n\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d Ilhor asked, though he didn\u2019t care to relax his grip. \u201cI defected. I defected!\u201d\n\nMy words barely squeezed out between his fingers. \u201cHadrian wouldn\u2019t let a defector live. Did you think an early retirement would save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you even find this place? He promised me it was safe!\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere\u2014\u201d I punched at his giant gauntlets like a child, gasping. \u201c\u2014is safe.\u201d\n\nHe grunted twice; once at me, and once at the ground.\n\nWith our weight combined, he sank past his ankles into the soft, dense mud that lined the lake's western shore. He dropped me, hoping it wasn\u2019t too late, then yanked at them fruitlessly\u2014an alligator has strength on the close, not open.\n\nI lunged, but his sword slammed into mine and sent it flying further into the forest than reality should allow, nesting into the canopy with a grating *buzz* like a silver beetle. A pained screech and flurry of wings rang out, followed by a distant, wooden *thunk*. Before I could look back in disdain, his blade was thrusting straight at my heart. I ducked, twisting, and barely managed to get low enough for it to deflect off my mail, then grabbed his wrists and pushed forward with all my weight to outstretch his arms.\n\nI only had a second before he'd overwhelm me, but that was all I needed. A small dagger, its polished gold hilt adorned with rubies, was partially hidden at his hip under a small flap of fraying linen. I let go of his off-hand, dropped even lower and grabbed it, then released his sword hand and pushed forward. In a blur of motion, I jammed the dagger into the thin gap between his helmet and breastplate just as his massive python of a left arm snapped at me again. A weary stumble backward was enough to escape his reach.\n\nHe struggled and sucked at the air, his words wet with blood. \u201cI\u2019m . . . not even . . . a king. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many innocent people did you kill for one?\u201d I whispered, hacking off his head.\n\n*That was for you, Ophelia. For our little ones.*\n\nHe plummeted into the coast, sinking into it a little bit. After a moment to collect myself, taking a few deep breaths, I was free to finally loot his body\u2014a vulture hungry for the treasure I could smell on him. Out of a covered compartment at his right hip, I pulled out a golden scroll with reverence, cupping it in my hands and brushing my thumbs across its complex network of embossed vines. It was the fifth one I'd stolen, and it was every bit as mesmerizing as the first, glowing as though the sun itself had been laid out in my still aching palms. I knelt there for some time, drinking its glow, and aches melted to memory with each moment. Eventually, I found it within myself to forfeit worship and tuck it into a satchel at my waist.\n\nMy fugitive beetle-sword was stuck in a tree nearly twenty yards away, with traces of blood on and around it. Splintered branches and shredded leaves littered the area, but there were no signs of life\u2014or death\u2014anywhere. I yanked it out, apologized to anything I may have harmed in Dominaria Forest, and ran back to the lake's edge.\n\n*Hidden. No patrols, no shipments, no trade. Forest for miles on all sides. How ironic that your pet\u2019s hiding place has become mine, Hadrian. It'll need a little cleanup, to say the least, but maybe this can be somewhere my roots can anchor.*\n\n*A place to belong.*\n\nAs I approached the castle, stepping over bodies like they were nothing more than fallen branches after a storm, a light, playful voice caught me off-guard.\n\n\"What a shame\u2014I wanted to kill him.\"\n\nI spun, reflexively unsheathing my sword to flare wary steel. A woman emerged from behind bark, crossing her arms and leaning lazily against the tree she'd been using for cover. Her weapon was unattended, dangling with a laxness inherited from its owner.\n\n\"I was rooting for you to lose, but your fighting skills are impressive. You're not like the others I\u2019ve run into around here,\" she continued, her gaze sharper than a blade fresh off of whetstone, her lips hinting at a smirk.\n\nI smiled as a cool breeze slid through thick trees, relaxing. \"Yeah. You seem . . . different, somehow. You seem real.\""

As Caius enters the trials, it becomes apparent that the tests themselves are not the problem: it is the twenty nine other candidates willing to do whatever it takes to win, including maim or kill their top competitors. Can Caius navigate the pitfalls of imperial politics and cutthroat competition, all while performing well enough to succeed in the trials fair and square?\n\nI'm also *thrilled* to have a physical copy of it!

A huge thanks go out to the redditors that helped me arrive at this point through their support, critiques, and kind words. [Kindle copies available for only $2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK), which can be read on phone, computer, or tablets!  \n\n**Here is chapter 1, which was the original response that spurred everything forwards**\n\nIt was an accident, of course.\n\nMy birth, my being in space, and well, I suppose I was an accident as well. An accident from the director of engineering screwing the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired; the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth. Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a mere maid much attention. After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars. I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well.\n\nBut there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid. For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall, she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform. As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness. As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different from anyone else.\n\nStar Child, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young. Star Child, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life. Star Child, she reprimanded whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point.\n\n\u201cWhen will I go to school?\u201d I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought-iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass.\n\n\u201cYou already go to school, Star Child,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot *that* school,\u201d I had said, pulling a face. \u201cI want to go to the academy. The special school, for the others like me!\u201d I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin.\n\n\u201cStar Child, listen and stop that at once,\u201d she said, her eyes level with mine. \u201cThere *are* no others like you. Those children; they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be. And they can't know, do you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I answered with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed. \u201cBut I don't like my school. Everyone there knows we can't be like them, that we can't be special.\u201d\n\n\u201cStar Child, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too. But not now \u2013 if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy. They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.\u201d\n\nAnd as I grew older, I realized that she was right. That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door and classified her on the spot. That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm during which she had been born. Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.\n\nSo instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day, I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library. From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.\n\nBut distractions came easy to me.\n\nAs I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police. The academy became increasingly harder to attend, and the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note. Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report. It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look to see who had thrown it.\n\nBut I would.

    "text": "**Reassignment**\n\nLeslie felt tired. He assumed he was supposed to, since this was the way he (and everyone else in his class) had always felt. As he awaited his turn to be called to the front of the stadium\u2014to be branded with a new job, new housing arrangement, possibly a new spouse and pet dog named Sophie\u2014he wondered what his new life would look like. Would he grow old as a construction worker, perhaps? Or an office manager, whatever vague responsibilities that entailed? Maybe a simple cashier at a grocery store, because in spite of new technologies, people still had to eat, and robots were no good at helping the elderly pack their vehicles with groceries.\n\nA quiet groan escaped him. He felt even more tired now. He entertained an unexpected thought: *Is this all my life is now? Is this all I can look forward to? A job?*\n\nHis name was called. Not his real name of Leslie Farringer Hill\u2014a confluence of his father Leslie\u2019s name as well as that of his great grandfather Farringer\u2014but his Assigned Name of 2099356. Leslie climbed onto a stage in the middle of an arena, where a line of stoic elders grasped their wrists and stared at him with grim indifference. Leslie sat beside dozens of civilians like himself, who sat before the Automated Work Reassignment bot, waiting for their assignments.\n\nLeslie placed his forehead against wide screen and allowed the machine to dig a thin needle into his cerebral cortex. The pain was minimal, surprisingly\u2014like the pinch you get when you pierce your ears. When it was done, Leslie and his classmates left the stage, and the elders announced, \u201cNext!\u201d\n\nNo applause. No congratulations. Just \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s grandfather said that Reassignment used to be exciting. People were given the option\u2014key word, \u201coption\u201d\u2014to change jobs if they were unhappy, medically disabled, or better suited to another field. A good many of them got to choose their own jobs\u2014a foreign concept to Leslie\u2019s class of 2118. But then, the option to \u201cchoose\u201d meant that jobs were in abundance, which had not been the case in half a century.\n\nWhen the first version of the Primary Automation Network\u2014or PAN\u2014was released, there was high demand for workers needing to maintain the program\u2019s vast webbing of databases, neural connections and information flow. Then the tech got smarter, and work done by human hands became outdated; PAN began functioning on its own, running its own updates and anticipating its own needs.\n\nThe human population, however, continued to rise, while jobs declined. Nowadays, you got what you got. You didn\u2019t argue or complain. If you did, you\u2019d starve\u2014and they\u2019d let you.\n\n\u201cHey, Les, what\u2019d they stick you with?\u201d Travis Dollman asked. Leslie noticed the shifting of his eyes back and forth as he gazed into his Internal Personalized Interface, which accessed the ever-growing layers of PAN.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know yet,\u201d Leslie replied. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to find out, either; he would have to live with his fate for the rest of his life. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cReading the job description right now,\u201d Travis said. He sounded distant, lost in the world of PAN. \u201cLooks like\u2026 Oh, hey! Not bad! Chief Agriculture Overseer for the\u2026 Ah, shit, in the Swamps. Oh well, it\u2019s good pay. Wife Meredith, Doberman Pixie, son named Liam. And triple supply of rations on a private acre. Not bad.\u201d\n\nTravis blinked, tuning out of his IPI. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna look at yours?\u201d\n\nLeslie shrugged. \u201cLater. I\u2019m tired. Had to do a double-shift last night, didn\u2019t sleep much. I think I\u2019ll go crash at the apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, at least look and see if you still *have* an apartment first.\u201d He grinned slyly, like he was telling a good joke that Leslie would never get. \u201cWho knows? Maybe you landed a gig with Infinitum. They get crazy-good benefits.\u201d\n\nLeslie returned a shy smile. \u201cDoubt it, but\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nLeslie pulled up his IPI and dove into PAN\u2019s universe. His system calibrated updates in seconds, a nice blinking clock telling him that it was 59 percent complete\u2026 73 percent\u2026 95 percent\u2026\n\nWhen it finished, a welcome letter greeted him. It read:\n\nCongratulations on your Reassignment, 2099356! You have been reassigned to occupation:\n\nSERIAL KILLER\n\nThat didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded like\u2026 well, not anything that Leslie had heard of, actually. The only thing familiar to him was the word \u201ckill,\u201d which was spoken when something electronic sparked in his office and the Electrical Technicians had to \u201ckill\u201d the connection. He supposed it could also pertain to when the elderly had reached their time of Passage, when they grew too old to perform their jobs appropriately and were euthanized; it was sometimes morbidly referred to as the \u201ctime of killing,\u201d a phrase Leslie and the general population repulsed.\n\nBut \u201cserial killer\u201d was something new to him. Below his title, an icon of a file folder blinked deep red at him, indicating the position was high level and top secret. Which meant upper echelon access into the depths of PAN, which very few civilians knew about, let alone explored.\n\nBelow that was a list of his benefits package: Fully-furnished housing on a five-acre plot (an ungodly amount of living space in today\u2019s economy), wife Blaise Parkham, a gray Persian named Mufasa, and five times the normal ration supply delivered weekly to his doorstep.\n\n*Holy shit,* Leslie thought. He blinked and closed his IPI.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Travis asked impatiently.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Something in agriculture, too.\u201d\n\nTravis squinted at him. *\u201cSomething in agriculture?* What the hell does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I dunno. It\u2019s a lot to read and I\u2019m too tired. I\u2019ll, uh\u2026 talk to you about it later. Need to rest.\u201d\n\nLeslie nearly ran out of the building. He felt Travis\u2019s suspicious gaze on him, but he brushed it off. He felt uneasy, his adrenaline pumping faster than he was used to. If he was going to live in high-class, he needed to figure out what his job entailed, and he couldn\u2019t concentrate with Travis\u2019s never-ending monologue in his ear.\n\nLeslie walked down the street, passing beneath the mousetraps of tram cars that ran noisily all day and night. Directly outside of Town Hall, a line of Individually Automated Vehicles awaited their passengers. He\u2019d never had a car\u2014had only set foot in one once, in fact. He had always relied on his feet for transportation. The 120-degree heat and omnipresent cloud of smoke lingering in the air had ceased to bother him.\n\nAbout halfway home, a sleek charcoal vehicle stopped beside him. A door popped open and a charming female voice spoke: \u201cPassenger 2099356, you may now enter your vehicle.\u201d\n\n*Mine? No way. Not mine.*\n\nA few seconds later, the voice beckoned him again: \u201cPassenger 2099356, please enter your vehicle and select your destination.\u201d\n\nLeslie warily stepped into the car. On the dashboard was a map of Ponderosa Pines, with a blue circle in the top left corner that read, \u201cHome.\u201d Leslie selected it, and 45 minutes later arrived at a large residence on Old Bakery Avenue. It was surrounded by a stone fence. The car approached a broad metal gate. The gate\u2019s sensor connected to the car\u2019s dashboard and asked for Leslie\u2019s fingerprints. Leslie placed a hand on the screen, his identity was verified, and the gate opened.\n\nInside the fence, pine trees rose to staggering heights, dropping streams of needles and cones as the wind tossed them about. Beyond the trees was a stone mansion, painted white with black highlights around the windows and door frames. Two cars were parked out front\u2014one for him and one for Blaise, he presumed.\n\nHe exited the car and entered into a wide-open living room, freshly painted and sparsely furnished. A chandelier hung above a staircase that led to the second and third floors.\n\nIn the far room at the other end of the house, a 90-inch television blasted music videos. Leslie could see the back of a woman\u2019s black-haired head.\n\n\u201c2099356, I presume?\u201d the black-haired head asked without turning around.\n\n\u201cCall me Leslie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me Blaise. Or 2105344, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d\n\nLovely.\n\nLeslie climbed the stairs and found a bedroom with a double-king bed, which he presumed he was supposed to share with Blaise. Upon it, a royal gray Persian named Mufasa yawned at him, his red collar jingling as the cat shook his head.\n\nLeslie climbed into bed and refreshed his IPI. The number of databases he could access in PAN as a Mini Mart clerk\u2014his first job\u2014numbered in the low 100s. As a serial killer, they numbered at 989, 341, 863\u2014and the numbers rose every few milliseconds.\n\nLeslie frantically searched for anything related to \u201cserial killer,\u201d and began queuing thousands of historical documents and videos and biographical entries to download simultaneously. An alert rose on his IPI stating that his downloading power was insufficient for such high-speed traffic\u2014would he like to upgrade to the latest version 13.4.57?\n\n*Latest version?* he thought. *I never imagined upgrading to anything higher than a 3.0.1, let alone the* latest version *of IPI software.*\n\nHe agreed to the Terms of Use and\u2014without suffering penalties to his weekly rations, to his surprise\u2014the latest update of IPI was downloaded.\n\nAnd with it, seconds later, gigabytes of information about serial killers from the infinite PAN.\n\nGigabytes of blood, torture, dismemberment and murder. Videos that immortalized the terror of the victims as well as the ecstasy on the faces of the voyeurs who slayed them.\n\nGigabytes of autopsy reports from the 21st century detailing the gunshot wounds, burns, incisions, and dismemberments of millions of victims\u2014and the biographical recounting of the sadistic rituals the preceded them.\n\nGigabytes of accounts detailing how to stalk a victim before the kill; how to kill and dispose of a body; the best tools to make it quick, or make it slow\u2026\n\nLeslie\u2019s vision turned white as the information was pummeled into his IPI. He blinked hard to log out of it. Then he turned over the side of his bed and vomited all over the hardwood floor. He vomited four more times until his body ached and vibrated.\n\nHis IPI popped up unexpectedly\u2014which shouldn\u2019t have happened. There were built-in codes which disallowed the software to act without permission from the host. But, Leslie thought, maybe it was just a feature that came with the high-profile job. A new message alerted him:\n\nGreetings, 2099356! Your first assignment is:\n\nLYLE MCCATHERN\n\nLocation:\n\n1573 E. FAUBREY LANE\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n26 HOURS\n\n*Shit, what does that mean?* Leslie thought.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it means, numb nuts?\u201d he argued aloud with himself. \u201cIt means you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cKill what?\u201d Blaise asked, standing in the doorway. Leslie startled at her appearance.\n\n\u201cOh my *god,*\u201d Blaise exclaimed, noticing the pile of vomit. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d\n\nLeslie hurriedly covered the vomit with the bedsheets. \u201cUh, no\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you need to kill something,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cIs there an electrical problem? Do we need an Electrical Technician, or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll handle that, too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nAn awkward silence hung in the air. Then, another message appeared in the IPI:\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nHATCHET\n\nLeslie\u2019s heart plummeted into his guts. He nearly puked a seventh time. He choked it back, swallowing painfully.\n\nBlaise sat on the other side of the bed. \u201cSo\u2026 I guess we\u2019re married now. You wanna\u2026 I dunno, go on a date, or something?\u201d\n\nLYLE MCCATHERN. 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE. 26 HOURS. HATCHET.\n\n*Jesus Christ.*\n\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Blaise demanded.\n\n\u201cYeah, a date. Sure. Tomorrow. I have some work to do.\u201d\n\nBlaise scoffed. \u201cAlready? Jeez, you just started, like, an hour ago.\u201d\n\nLeslie nodded uncertainly. \u201cLots to do, I guess.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHis first kill was awful. And messy\u2014*really* messy. Why a hatchet was chosen for him, he didn\u2019t know. But he sensed that, somewhere beyond the IPI, PAN itself was watching him. He\u2019d been in the workforce long enough to realize that if you didn\u2019t fulfill your job requirements\u2014 all T\u2019s crossed and I\u2019s dotted\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be granted leeway or forgiveness. Your rations, valuable as they were, would be first to suffer.\n\nAfter that, shit would keep rolling downhill.\n\nLeslie accessed his PAN downloads on disposing a body and then how to extract evidence from a crime scene. He had to vomit multiple times into the garbage bags he used to mop up Lyle McCathern\u2019s remains. He finished at the 23-hour mark, and PAN was satisfied.\n\nA new message appeared, with an icon of a cake with flaming candles beneath it:\n\nCongratulations on completing your first assignment, 2099356!\n\nNext assignment to be uploaded in:\n\n56.6334 HOURS\n\nAs the slaughtered remains of Lyle McCathern\u2014just some Joe Schmo who worked at a brewery, it seemed\u2014incinerated in a pit beside him, Leslie cupped his hands over his face and sobbed.\n\nHe sobbed. And retched. And sobbed some more.\n\nThen he went home and stayed in bed until his next assignment.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe went on dates with Blaise. They exchanged half-hearted conversation. He stroked the fur along Mufasa\u2019s spine, making the cat purr contentedly. He sat in front of the television with his new family and watched movies to which he couldn\u2019t pay attention.\n\nBecause the information lurking in his mind was as alluring as it was insidious. Leslie didn\u2019t appreciate the allure, but he acknowledged it was there. He found himself accessing crevices of PAN that housed information he would have never considered. Some of the terms he came across\u2014murder, crime, torture\u2014had been deleted from public access decades after PAN was invented, Leslie discovered. With centralized control of PAN solely in the hands of one corporation, Infinitum, coupled with the mandatory law that IPI\u2019s be implanted at birth, it was easy for them to conceal and reveal whatever information they wanted.\n\nAnd now Leslie had unrestricted access to it.\n\nAt the 56.6334-hour mark, Leslie received a new message on his IPI. He uttered a worried half-groan before the software consumed him:\n\nGood afternoon, 2099356!\n\nYour next assignment is:\n\nJAMES AND JILL HAWTHORNE\n\nLocation:\n\nMILDRED\u2019S COFFEE HOUSE\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nGLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n2 HOURS\n\nLeslie searched for Mildred\u2019s Coffee House on his IPI map. It was nearly an hour away by car. And he had no idea where he would have the time to find a Glock 43, whatever that was, and kill two people\u2014*two* of them. In a public place.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Blaise asked, not looking away from the television.\n\n\u201cWork again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know when you\u2019ll be back?\u201d\n\nLeslie sighed. \u201cSoon, probably.\u201d\n\nThe car door opened automatically for him. It received notifications when Leslie received missions. It sped down the highway at top speed, as if it understood his time constraints.\n\nThen, a hidden compartment opened beside the map screen. Leslie reached in and extracted a couple of things. First, a handgun\u2014the Glock 43 with a silencer, he guessed. He\u2019d never held a gun before, so he sifted through dozens of links on gun handling before reaching the coffee shop.\n\nThe other items included a denim jacket, a fake goatee, sunglasses, and a baseball cap representing a team he didn\u2019t recognize.\n\n*PAN is teaching me how to be a serial killer,* Leslie thought. He applied the accessories. He was grateful for the gesture, but didn\u2019t expect PAN\u2019s courtesy to last long; the automaton had never done him favors like this before. No sense in expecting the generosity to guide him through the rest of his life.\n\nMildred\u2019s was packed with people. Leslie had no idea coffee was such a hot commodity at one o\u2019 clock in the afternoon. The line dumped out of the front door and onto the surrounding sidewalk. Leslie took his place in line behind a fat couple and a yipey Yorkie with which they rubbed noses. *\u201cYou\u2019re such a good boy,\u201d* they coddled. *\u201cOh, what a good, good boy.\u201d*\n\nLeslie scanned through PAN to find out what James and Jill Hawthorne looked like: He, a pretty-boy millionaire-looking barbie in real estate with slick gray hair and an attractive layer of stubble; she, also a slick-haired real estate agent enticing enough to be in modeling or porn\u2014whichever PAN deemed most productive, Leslie scoffed.\n\nMusic blasted inside. People between the ages of 25 and 35 dominated the dining hall. Leslie glanced around, and spotted the couple in the corner. They looked sulky, certainly the least lively of the crowd, as if they\u2019d just had a fight.\n\nJesus, there were a lot of people. How could PAN expect Leslie to fulfill his job with three dozen witnesses surrounding him? He felt sweat seep from every pore on his body. His IPI announced that he had 35 minutes and 14 seconds remaining\u2026 13 seconds\u2026 12\u2026\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he mumbled. *\u201cFuck.\u201d*\n\nIn a panic, he nearly retreated to his IPI for guidance.\n\nBut then it hit him. That word: Panic.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d a bored, acne-infested barista inquired.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 Three black coffees, please,\u201d Leslie replied. He paid for the drinks, then carried them over to a low table surrounded by beanbags on which the still-sulking Hawthorne couple resided.\n\nLeslie took a deep breath. *Here goes.*\n\n\u201cHey, friends!\u201d his voice boomed. They looked at him with suspicion and confusion.\n\n\u201cRemember me? It\u2019s Marty! Your old pal!\u201d\n\nJill looked at James, and he returned her concerned glare. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jill began to say.\n\nLeslie interrupted her. \u201cCome on, you remember me! From college! We took the same algebra class!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nLeslie cut her off again. \u201cHere. Black coffee, just the way you like it. On the house. Come on, let\u2019s get a picture together, what do you say?\u201d\n\nImpatiently, he gestured for them to merge together on one chair. \u201cCome on, squeeze together, don\u2019t be shy. You\u2019re married, for crying out loud! You\u2019ve seen each other *naked!\u201d*\n\nThe Hawthornes laughed nervously. Leslie felt as nervous as they sounded.\n\nHe retrieved a phone from his pocket and loaded the camera app. \u201cAlright, now, smile and say cheese!\u201d\n\nThey did. Just before Leslie dialed the \u201cTake Photo\u201d button, he uncovered the Glock from behind his denim jacket. Jill Hawthorne noticed it. Leslie pulled the trigger twice\u2014a quick \u201cone, two.\u201d Jill\u2019s surprise turned to terror, then to realization that she\u2019d been shot and was seconds from death. James died without knowing he\u2019d been shot.\n\nThe camera snapped a picture.\n\nLeslie stuffed the gun back in his coat and sprang to his feet. *\u201cHO!\u201d* he screamed, waving his limbs wildly. *\u201cHoly SHIT! Sweet mother of CHRIST! SOMEBODY HELP!\u201d*\n\nCurious eyes moved to the dead bodies.\n\nThen: Panic.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nLeslie allowed himself to be swallowed by the frantic herd as people stormed to the front door and created a bottleneck. He was nearly crushed by the fat couple with their hideous Yorkie as they struggled to push through the doorway. Finally, he separated from the crowd and sprinted to his car. He selected \u201cDestination: Home.\u201d It took him nearly fifteen minutes to catch his breath, and another ten to slow his heart rate. He followed the procedures on shirking the evidence, then returned home.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Blaise said, still sitting in the same place on the couch as when Leslie had left. \u201cThat was quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leslie said, feeling breathless. \u201cEasy day.\u201d\n\nHe retreated to the king bed, where he expected once again to vomit and sob. But he didn\u2019t. In fact, he felt\u2026 good. Really good, actually. His IPI congratulated him once again, this time promising to deliver a tray of expensive cakes and sweets to his door within 24 hours.\n\nCakes aside, he felt lifted, as if the adrenaline boost had filled him with helium. He liked this airy feeling.\n\nAnd something else: He didn\u2019t feel remorse, as he had after bludgeoning Lyle McCathern. The bullets were quick and not nearly as messy as the damned hatchet. He could get used to bullets. It felt less personal. More like a job.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what it was.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeslie killed half a dozen more people in the subsequent month. A sleezy waitress in Nevada; a hokey bartender running for mayor in California; two airline attendants from an Asian country he didn\u2019t recognize (just some dull, primitive society that had outlawed PAN, as Leslie understood it).\n\nHis murders became famous on the news, though the media gave him the piss-poor, unimaginative name of the Ponderosa Pines Executioner. With millions of databases he could download in seconds, Leslie learned from the mistakes of the idiots of the past centuries. No evidence had been found to incriminate him. Fortunately for him, the criminal justice system had been gutted to the point of near obsolescence in the last 100 years. Thanks to the strong-armed, omniscient PAN, people knew what stepping out of the parameters set forth by PAN meant. They knew that a crime against PAN, no matter how small, would risk their lives.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know\u2014but Leslie now did\u2014was that a crime against PAN meant a violent, prolonged, agonizing death. PAN ensured that jobs of such a specialty were still around\u2014and well-compensated.\n\nNot only had Leslie gotten better at killing\u2014when he wasn\u2019t actually doing it, he was shuffling through thousands of digital archives learning about it\u2014but he thought he\u2019d gotten better about *not caring* about it. That is, until he had to kill two teenage parents of a four-year-old.\n\nLeslie hadn\u2019t noticed the kid standing in the hallway, watching as Leslie duct-taped his parents\u2019 mouths shut, strapped them to chairs and started drilling holes in them (the instrument of choice was an electric drill). He hadn\u2019t noticed the kid until he\u2019d burrowed a drill bit deep into his mother\u2019s skull and killed her.\n\n\u201cAh, shit,\u201d Leslie muttered.\n\nThe kid had just stood there, sucking his thumb, taking it all in. They stood in silence for a full minute. Then, Leslie left the kid alone in the house, got in the car, and went back home. Realizing the magnitude of what he\u2019d done, he vomited for the first time since Lyle McCathern.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he grumbled. He repeated it louder. *\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d*\n\nHe punched the dashboard. Then he did it again, and again, wailing on the thing. He started slamming his elbows and knees and feet around the car\u2019s interior, screaming and cursing. He threw himself about until it hurt, and continued until he felt like one giant, throbbing ache.\n\nWeakly, he picked up his phone to dial the police. A picture of the Hawthornes\u2019 dead bodies, taken just seconds after Leslie shot them, flashed on the screen. Leslie\u2019s lips trembled, and he broke out into hysterical sobbing. He threw his phone aside. He\u2019d forgotten about that picture. His first instinct was to smash the damned thing, destroy all traces of evidence.\n\nBut Leslie couldn\u2019t just ignore the kid. He\u2019d already left him alone in that house, amidst the grotesque corpses of his parents. He\u2019d hate himself forever if he just left the kid like that. He needed to call someone to that house to get the boy.\n\nOne of the things Leslie had repeatedly stumbled upon in the PAN archives was the remorselessness that seemed to be inherent in the most famous killers. Most of them felt no pity for the victims or their families, no regrets for their actions. In fact, a lot of them claimed they would do it again if they ever got out. They didn\u2019t have to think about how *not* to feel bad.\n\nLeslie wasn\u2019t that lucky.\n\nHe dialed the police number and reported a break-in. Then he hung up the phone, and forgot about smashing it. He felt tired, more so than he\u2019d felt at Reassignment last month. How he longed for a chance to change jobs, like his grandfather Farringer had done before him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Leslie spoke out loud. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not a serial killer.\u201d\n\nHe knew PAN could hear him, even when he wasn\u2019t logged in to the IPI. Leslie expected the IPI to activate any moment to deliver a personal message from PAN saying Leslie was out of line. A reminder that \u201cbreach of a worker\u2019s protocol with daily job-related task ensures penalties commensurate with the worker\u2019s offense, with punishments to be fulfilled in accordance with PAN Law 00841.\u201d\n\nYeah, Leslie had known it by heart since his early childhood school days. It meant that whole violent, prolonged, agonizing death thing.\n\nBut no message came. Surely PAN had heard him, but it didn\u2019t have anything to say.\n\nLeslie rolled over to cry some more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeslie threw his phone down on the king bed. It landed next to Mufasa, who sniffed it considerately, then flinched away with disgust. Leslie barged into his bathroom and slammed the door shut. He felt overheated and sweaty. He turned the shower faucet to cold. He didn\u2019t bother to remove his clothes. He stood beneath the water until cold tremors shook his body.\n\nThere was a knock at the bathroom door. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Blaise shouted.\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t answer right away. Blaise asked him twice more, her tone of voice becoming more afraid each time.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Leslie mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nA message arrived in his IPI:\n\nGreetings, 2099356!\n\nYour next assignment is:\n\nBLAISE PARKHAM\n\nLocation:\n\n1066 OLD BAKERY AVENUE\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nGLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n3.43 MINUTES\n\nNo. No, something was wrong. A bug, a glitch. Something. It wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cWhat the *fuck?\u201d* Blaise\u2019s scream sent shivers along Leslie\u2019s spine, as strong as the cold water shivers he felt now.\n\nLeslie shut off the water and dashed out of the bathroom, water cascading off his sopping clothes. In the bedroom, Blaise stared incredulously into Leslie\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck *is* this?\u201d\n\nShe held out the phone, which brandished the image of the dead Hawthornes. Leslie\u2019s heart pounded wildly, then sank into his bowels.\n\n\u201cWhy were you looking through my phone?\u201d he asked. His voice was steady in spite of his shivering.\n\nBlaise snorted. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to say? Tell me what the fuck this picture is doing on your fucking phone, Les.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA bitter smile drew across Blaise\u2019s lips. She shook her head slowly. \u201cThese pictures were on the news. Are you the Executioner?\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s silence and downward gaze told Blaise all she needed to know.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d she said.\n\nThe timer in Leslie\u2019s IPI dipped below two minutes. The numbers pulsed in blood-red, in sync with his own heartbeat. PAN began listing the consequences of Leslie\u2019s failure to complete the assignment.\n\nLeslie held up his hands, both empty, for Blaise to see. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a towel. When I come out, let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nHe retreated into the bathroom. He picked up his gun. He returned to the bedroom and pointed the muzzle at Blaise\u2019s chest.\n\nHer eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s IPI counted down the seconds: 52\u2026 51\u2026 50\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your job now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Blaise asked. \u201cThe Pines Executioner thing. It\u2019s why our rations are so high. Why you keep disappearing, sometimes for days.\u201d\n\n40\u2026 39\u2026 38\u2026\n\nLeslie thought of the kid standing in the hallway, and Leslie standing beside the dead parents. It occurred to him that PAN knew everything, including what Leslie was doing right at that moment. It knew every detail about every killer before him. And it was adding Leslie, the first serial killer in 100 years, to its database. Leslie Farringer Hill, the Pines Executioner. He slaughtered a family and ruined a kid\u2019s life\u2026 because he was Reassigned.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he whimpered, a line of tears running past his nose. He shook his head angrily. \u201c*No.\u201d*\n\n19\u2026 18\u2026 17\u2026\n\nLeslie hurtled the gun against a far wall. \u201cGet out of here,\u201d he commanded.\n\nBlaise didn\u2019t hesitate. She dropped the phone and sprinted for the door, leaving Leslie as alone as he\u2019d left the little boy.\n\nThe timer expired. The IPI deemed the assignment a failure. It commanded Leslie to stay in his place of residency, reminded him penalties would be issued in accordance with PAN Law 00841\u2026 So on and so forth.\n\nLeslie stripped out of his clothes, lay naked on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. It was the last time he would set foot in a house like this.\n\nHe stroked Mufasa\u2019s cheeks and chin, enjoying the hum of the cat\u2019s purr.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDays later, once the Law Enforcement Branch had caught up with PAN\u2019s report on Leslie\u2019s failure to provide adequate work output, they came for him. They broke into Leslie\u2019s bedroom, stuffed his head in a black bag, and shoved his naked body into a car he couldn\u2019t see.\n\nHe spent two weeks in a cold dungeon. The walls echoed with each breath he took\u2014as well as every beating, stabbing, and burning his hoarse voice protested.\n\nA week into the torture, a voice spoke to him. A woman\u2019s voice, though it sounded deep like a man\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about the Rebellion?\u201d the voice asked.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\nA fist collided with Leslie\u2019s solar plexus, knocking the air out of his lungs.\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Rebellion,\u201d the voice said.\n\nLeslie struggled to catch his breath. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch him to make sure,\u201d the voice instructed.\n\nThe hands that had winded him grasped his head and held it still. A high-pitched whirring sound drew close to his head.\n\nThen a sharp stabbing pain electrified every nerve in Leslie\u2019s body as a thin metal wire was inserted into his cerebral cortex. Leslie screamed, but couldn\u2019t tell if the high pitch was from the wire or his voice.\n\nThe pain lasted a long time. How long, Leslie couldn\u2019t know; there was no sunlight to guide his sense of time in the dungeon. Eventually, it stopped, and Leslie was allowed a brief break.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d the woman\u2019s voice demanded.\n\nA low, grunting man spoke. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow thorough was your search?\u201d\n\nHesitation in the man\u2019s voice. \u201cPretty thorough.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Pretty thorough\u2019 does not mean thorough. Do it again.\u201d\n\nThe whirring sound. The blinding pain.\n\nAnd more screaming.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe sessions went on for days. Leslie\u2019s nerves throbbed and he could barely move.\n\nThe door to his dungeon squeaked open. Footsteps approached his quivering body. He tried to speak\u2014\u201cno, please, no more\u201d\u2014but his voice was too hoarse, his lungs too tired, his body too shaky.\n\n\u201cCome with me, Mr. Hill.\u201d Leslie recognized the deep-toned woman\u2019s voice.\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t move.\n\nThe woman sighed. \u201cGet him up.\u201d\n\nStrong, rough hands lifted Leslie by the armpits and dragged him into a bright hallway. The light pierced his eyes and brain. He scrunched his eyes closed, providing mild relief.\n\nMinutes later, when he could open his eyes, Leslie saw he was being led into a large courtroom. He sat before a panel of disinterested elderly people in black robes. Their table was raised several feet higher than Leslie\u2019s chair.\n\nA gaunt-faced woman with blonde hair sat in the center of the panel, peering down at Leslie\u2019s naked figure. \u201cState your name for the record.\u201d Her voice was sharp.\n\nLeslie tried to speak, but his throat burned. He swallowed a few times to soothe the sandpaper feeling, but still only managed to grunt a few painful syllables.\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes. \u201cYour name, please.\u201d\n\nBetween hacking coughs, Leslie managed: \u201cL-Leslie\u2026 F-Farr-ring-ger\u2026 H-H-Hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Hill, you have been charged by the High Court of Infinitum and Our Majesty the Primary Automation Network with failure to produce adequate service to the Union as part of your daily job duties. The proper punishment for such an offense, in accordance with PAN Law, is death.\u201d\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t respond. This wasn\u2019t news to him. He\u2019d expected to die days ago. He was baffled that he was still alive.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the blonde woman continued, \u201cupon reviewing the information extracted from your IPI, it appears you are the victim of a glitch in PAN\u2019s system. The glitch was detected just hours ago, and is believed to have been caused by a virus implanted by a faction group known as the Rebellion.\u201d\n\nLeslie shook his head. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve never heard of them, Mr. Hill,\u201d the woman interrupted impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you. Your Reassignment to the position of \u2018serial killer\u2019\u2014a position that is not a true occupation, but a primitive criminal activity banned by PAN law\u2014is something the Rebellion fabricated within PAN\u2019s framework. The virus corrupted parts of PAN\u2019s processing centers, and you were unlucky enough to be at the receiving end of this treachery during the Automated Work Reassignment. Due to your unwitting compliance in an act of treason against the Union, through no fault or knowledge of your own, you have been exonerated of all charges regarding your work performance failure.\u201d\n\nLeslie breathed deeply. \u201cSo\u2026 I can live.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect, Mr. Hill. However, after discovering your hidden identity as the Ponderosa Pines Executioner and your role in the forceful removal of nine workers of the Union, you will incur penalties commensurate with those listed in accordance with PAN Law 09663, as repayment for their sudden loss in productivity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I get to live.\u201d\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes again and ignored him. \u201cYou will be Reassigned in the main lobby of this building before leaving. You will then be escorted to your new place of residency, where you will be allowed one day of rest and healing. Beginning Monday morning, you will report for work as specified in your occupational handbook.\u201d\n\nA large book was thrust into Leslie\u2019s arms. He was given clean clothes and a ride to his new 12-by-12 apartment. And, of course, he received a new job.\n\nHe spent hours reading the manual on how to perform his duties as an Agricultural Secretary.\n\nEventually, he fell asleep and dreamed about nothing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLife went on. Leslie went to work on Monday and discovered that he was Agricultural Secretary to Travis Dollman, and so realized his fate was to not only file papers and answer phone calls but to endure the endless monologue of his new boss.\n\nNew stories of the \u201cPAN glitches\u201d began to pop up in the news regularly. Leslie wasn\u2019t the only one Reassigned to a fake job. Apparently terrorism, gun smuggling, and rioting were circulating as legitimate occupations in the Work Reassignment Centers, and authorities at Infinitum hadn\u2019t figured out how to counteract the damage that had been done.\n\nLeslie took a huge cut in his ration supply: 0.25 times the average distribution (down from five times the normal amount in his previous \u201coccupation\u201d), to be carried out for the rest of his life. That was okay. Leslie could learn to live with less food and electricity.\n\nA month into his job as Agricultural Secretary, Leslie\u2019s bruises and lacerations had healed. He had a half-dozen scars where the probe had been inserted into his brain. He thought about his previous Reassignment every day, and the chaos and trauma it caused him and others.\n\nHe leaned against a rounded metal fence at the side of a river that crept between two cities. He felt a hand touch his spine. He spun around and saw the face of Blaise Parkham.\n\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d she said sadly.\n\nHe nodded politely. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made it out in one piece.\u201d She rubbed a finger over his scars. \u201cWell, not quite, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I just wanted to thank you for what you did.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cFor what I\u2026 did?\u201d\n\nShe handed him a flyer, black and white with intricate geometric patterns in the corners. In the center, it read:\n\nRAISE YOUR FISTS\n\nFIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nDOWN WITH THE GOD MACHINE\n\nJOIN THE REBELLION\n\nLeslie glanced from the flyer back to Blaise. \u201cThat was you? Everything I did\u2026 was because of you?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cNot me personally. But yeah. My people.\u201d\n\nLeslie balled up the flyer in one hand. He felt angry enough to rip the metal fence from the ground.\n\n\u201cYou used me as a tool. For what? This?\u201d He shook the balled-up flyer in his hand. \u201cThe Rebellion?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a chance to live a free life.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free life?\u201d Leslie shrieked. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would you want that, if this is what we have to go through? We have work, housing, a steady supply of rations. Why do you care so much about your stupid cause that you\u2019re willing to fuck everybody else to get it?\u201d\n\nBlaise pursed her lips. \u201cBecause Infinitum is pumping out killers, too. Not serial killers, but silent ones. They go into the houses of Rebellion members and black bag them. We don\u2019t ever see them again. Those people you killed? We assigned you to do it because they were killing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? A brewery worker, a couple of real estate agents, a waitress? Two parents with a four-year-old child? These are the evil Rebellion killers?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, ignoring the sarcasm. \u201cYes, they were. And they are just a microcosm of a massive, suppressed regime sanctioned by PAN itself.\u201d\n\nLeslie shook his head. He couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nAs if reading his thoughts, Blaise said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe me. But it\u2019s true. Have a look for yourself.\u201d\n\nShe offered him a tiny cardboard box large enough to house a wedding ring. Inside was a small chip with long, thin needles attached to it.\n\n\u201cI know your access to PAN is limited again. This will give you full access to all of its databases for 12 hours. After that, it fries. It\u2019s not traceable, the encryption guarantees that. Just\u2026 take a look and see for yourself that I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d\n\nLeslie pocketed the device. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he muttered bitterly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we used you,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. But my convictions haven\u2019t changed. I know why it had to be done. We had to send PAN and Infinitum a message. If I had to do it again, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would let me kill a boy\u2019s parents in front of him again? For what? A chance at chipping away fragments of the so-called God Machine?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cNot so you could kill a child\u2019s parents, no. But for a chance to give that child a free world again, and his children after him? Yes, I would.\u201d\n\nThey were silent for a long time. They stared at the horizon, the unwavering buildings set atop the restless water below. \u201cPAN and Infinitum don\u2019t care about us, Les,\u201d Blaise continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about anything but productivity, output, results. As long as they get that, the ends justify the means. They don\u2019t care that we\u2019re human beings, that we need more than just a stupid job. We need a purpose. And we need the room to find out for ourselves what that means.\u201d\n\nLeslie clenched his teeth, unwilling to release his bitterness. \u201cI have a purpose. I\u2019m an Agricultural Secretary. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nBlaise stuffed her hands in her pockets and gave Leslie a light, sympathetic kiss on his cheek.\n\n\u201cLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d\n\nShe left Leslie alone by the lake.\n\nLeslie retrieved the tiny device from his pocket. He weighed the device and the crumpled flyer in his hands. He unfolded the flyer, smoothed out the wrinkles and read it again.\n\nWhen he got home, he laid in bed for a long time, staring up at the ceiling. He unwrapped the tiny device and considered it.\n\nHe logged into his IPI. Then he lifted the chip to his forehead, and dug the needles into his scars.\n\nedit: Wow.

    "prompt": "[OT] Ten months ago I responded to a prompt about a swordsman who mastered every fighting technique known to man, one so good that they are able to parry Death\u2019s final swing. Today, the first book of By The Sword entitled \u201cBlood and Steel\u201d is a published novel!",

    "text": "Hello WritingPrompts!\n\nLike the title says, about ten months ago, I found myself responding to this prompt one night:\n\n> [**[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/)\n\nThen, after serializing it on my subreddit and turning it into a story larger than I ever thought possible, I arrived at the decision about whether to make it a book. For a lot of writers, publishing a book is *the dream*, and in all honesty, I didn\u2019t think I would ever actually do it. But now, after a lot of procrastination, a lot of late nights, a lot of learning, and a ton of editing, it\u2019s here.\n\nThe entire series, named By The Sword, is a high fantasy trilogy of books with paranormal/supernatural elements, of which I\u2019m publishing the first right now which comes in just shy of 100k words long. The book\u2019s cover art was done by the fantastic /u/IsmaelGil, and I\u2019m extremely happy with [how it turned out!](https://i.imgur.com/JIY228X.jpg)\n\nAs the title of this post says, that book is entitled Blood and Steel. You can read its synopsis right here:\n\n> Death is a fickle thing.\n\n> For most, it\u2019s a force of nature, but Agil Novan sees the reaper in a different light. As the greatest swordsman of all time, he cherishes life, and he\u2019s lived one full of both struggle and success. After all of his accomplishments, he too must face the reaper and its scythe.\n\n> When challenged, however, the swordsman is not one to go without a fight. After parrying it once and impressing the reaper with a show of the blade, he is offered something more. A second chance at life\u2014one that he is all but forced to accept.\n\n> Now, stranded in an unfamiliar land with an unfamiliar body and far too many questions, Agil has his life threatened at every turn. Still, he is determined to survive. He knows what the reaper did to him. \n\n> And he has never been one to let vengeance go unfulfilled.\n\n**You can check out the Amazon page for Blood and Steel [here, where you can buy it as an ebook!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT)**\n\nThe ebook is priced at $2.99 and the paperback is priced at $9.99.\n\nThe book is also available in a myriad of other marketplaces:\n\n***Kindle Ebook***\n\n[**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**NL**](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**BR**](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**CA**](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**MX**](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**AU**](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07X6S9FRT) \n\n***Physical Paperback***\n\n*Note: With Kindle\u2019s Matchbook program, you can get a free ebook copy with any paperback purchase!*\n\n[**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1089217587) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1089217587) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1089217587) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1089217587) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/1089217587) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/1089217587) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/1089217587)\n\n---\n\nIf you do end up reading the book, please consider leaving a review as well!

That was the way I lived for so long.\n\nIt was an old adage\u2014ancient even, depending on the version being told, but it was a useful one for someone like me. \n\nI was first told it by my father during the final years of his life. It came only a few short months after I started training, in fact. A few short months of becoming fascinated by the art of sword-fighting and spending every waking minute trying to master it.\n\nMy father was proud of me for my effort. He always gave me the largest smile when I explained this stance or that, detailing my dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman of them all. Of becoming a Knight of Credon and protecting our kingdom more effectively than any before me. He entertained my teenage ramblings without complaint. And since he\u2019d been a swordsman himself during his formative years, he made sure to pass off that ancient wisdom before it became too late.\n\nIt was the last gift he ever gave me.\n\nIf only I\u2019d known how true it was.\n\nThat mantra repeated in my head now as I stared across my path. Standing out there in my field, only a few dozen paces away from me, the reaper stared right back. Wind billowed through its tattered black cloak. It made no effort to conceal the bleached bone underneath. All it did was balance its scythe in skeletal fingers as though taunting me to come and fight.\n\nI wondered why it didn\u2019t simply attack me for my ignorance, why it didn\u2019t finish the job after I had ignored all of the signs. A tense pain in my chest and a sudden shortness of breath were the only warnings I\u2019d gotten during my morning walk. But before the reaper had appeared, I\u2019d shrugged them both off. I\u2019d been stupid and short-sighted enough to allow my time to come.\n\nYet the reaper just stood there, watching me.\n\nWith my sword held at the ready, I considered if it was scared. Whether or not it was doubting the frozen moment in time when its scythe would harvest my soul. Perhaps it hadn\u2019t expected me to resist, I ventured. After all, landing a strike on a swordsman of my caliber wasn\u2019t easy for anyone.\n\nThe rational part of me didn\u2019t think that was it, though. It didn\u2019t fit with the concept of the end-bringer at all. The beast of decay was part of nature as we were told; it was integral to the cycle of the world. And while I\u2019d never entirely agreed with that interpretation, especially not after my father had been ripped away from his life, it still shouldn\u2019t have had any issue with a measly swordsman.\n\nThen again, the word measly hadn\u2019t described me for decades.\n\nI stepped forward, my foot crunching on the path I walked almost every morning. *My* path, I reminded myself. The tranquil sanctuary that I\u2019d cultivated for years. I was supposed to be safe when I walked it, and I had been until *it* had shown up.\n\nA sneer formed on my face as I continued to approach. Its tattered cloak still drifted on the wind. Its scythe still balanced in silence. But as I neared, it looked up. It stared at me, nearly striking fear into my heart.\n\nThe reaper stopped and raised its scythe. It angled the ever-sharpened metal in my direction. For a moment, I could\u2019ve sworn I saw a smile on its face. But I wasn\u2019t sure, as it was already charging my way.\n\nMy body surged into action. The reaper disappeared from its spot and struck through the air like lightning to force me down with its scythe. Yet as the frozen moment passed with the shriek of clashing metal, I was left standing. The resistance was still fresh in my bones.\n\nI\u2019d parried it, I realized, on instinct and fear alone. As I glared back at its still form once more, picking apart details of the bone, I saw the surprise. I knew what it meant. The beast had never been parried before.\n\nA grin grew across my lips as I readied my blade again. Its surprise would keep the scythe at bay for the moment, but I still had to be ready. I would never let my guard down.\n\nAs I\u2019d expected, the surprise faded in short time and it was on me again. I watched it charge with inhuman speed, almost gliding over the ground. I only dodged with a stumble as its scythe cut right through where I\u2019d been.\n\nThat attack had been faster than before, I noted. It had hit closer. I had to be ready.\n\nI furrowed my brows and felt ice-cold fire flood my veins. It signaled the onset of battle, and I took the change in stride. Feeling the burn of sunlight on my skin, I stared back at the beast with everything I had and only barely ducked its next attempt at my life. The blade came through right where my head had been.\n\nThe scythe, however, never reached my former location. Instead, it turned at the last second. But even with the turn of steel, I was ready. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book. \n\nI parried the hit without a second thought. \n\nSurprise returned to its hooded, bleach-white face. The beast stared down at its unstained scythe, and I had to stifle a chuckle. It didn\u2019t matter how fast it was. I would never let my guard down. \n\nI leapt backward, my feet already positioning themselves for the next attack. The beast growled, its tone dark enough to strike terror in any ordinary mind. But I was no ordinary mind\u2014even at my age, I was as sharp. \n\nI narrowed my eyes, brought my sword out to the defense, and ignored the call to blunder. Its skeletal form charged me again\u2014just as I\u2019d predicted. My lips curled slightly as I turned in the nick of time and whipped the hilt of my blade around my wrist.\n\nThe clang that rang out was one to split mountains.\n\nBoth of our weapons fell, but I was more than ready for it. I swept mine up in an instant and was already twisting away. A smile blossomed across my lips. I would never let my guard down. \n\nThen, spinning back with my blade in hand, I shoved steel deep into the hooded cloak. My ears twitched at the screech of metal tearing through bone.\n\nAs soon as I heard it, I retracted my arm. My feet pushed me backward, and I swung my blade out to guard. Looking over the serene path turned battlefield, I saw too many familiar things. The ornate stone lining in the dirt. The shaded patch of trees. My humble homestead barely visible over the hills.\n\nIt had no right to be here, I told myself. It had no right to take me here. This was my *home,* world\u2019s dammit. And I would never let my guard down.\n\nImages flashed through my mind\u2014parries, deflects, attacks. I was ready. The power in my muscles was already responding to clean commands. But as it turned out, none of it was needed.\n\nThe beast stood, paralyzed. \n\nCarrying the same surprise it had shown seconds before, the reaper stared at the grass. Its ash-black robe wavered in the breeze and its skeletal form hunched as though responding to a weight. Watching it, I relaxed my shoulders a hair. The situation was painted clear as day on its face. It had never been hit before either.\n\nRagged black cloth lifted back off its head to expose pale white bone to the sunlight above. Its dark eyes were riddled with confusion when it turned to me. It stared, and I almost looked, almost sealed my glorious fate. But at the last moment, I recognized the trick. \n\nDarkness crawled out of its eyes. I snapped mine shut before it could take me, my father\u2019s proud face flashing in my mind. Another one of his warnings played back through my head.\n\n*Never look into the face of death.*\n\nThe embodiment of decay rushed at me anew\u2014I felt it in the air. Heard it. *Smelled* it. Its speed was even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike. Even with my eyes closed, with my most important sense stripped away, I would never let my guard down.\n\nI snapped my eyes open while sprinting away, readied for the attacks that were sure to hit my unarmed side. I waited, my ears perked and my eyes sharp. The strikes never came. \n\nAfter a dozen strides, I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn\u2019t. Instead, I saw the beast\u2019s cracked, white skull with the hood completely off.\n\nBitterness fell on my tongue. It coated my mouth with disgust. I felt power radiating from in front of me; I felt it washing off the bone. Simply looking into its face forced my blood to run cold. Where I\u2019d expected to see the same complete and utter shock, I saw confirmation of what I hadn\u2019t wanted to be true. An expression more terrifying than any other.\n\nA smile.\n\nThe crooked, skeletal grin was perfect and horrid at the same time. It spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. I was a warrior, a swordsman, a *knight*\u2014I didn\u2019t have time for worry. And yet, as I felt my gaze stay frozen, the dread only deepened. \n\nThe beast didn\u2019t rush at me. It didn\u2019t move to attack. It didn\u2019t even reach for its scythe. For some reason, it seemed done with the fight.\n\n\u201cImpressive display,\u201d it said, words reaching my ears on the wind. Its voice came like the concept of decay itself, forcing me to shudder as it ate at my mind. I hadn\u2019t seen its bony mouth move an inch.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself into stance.\n\nThe beast noticed and raised a dismissive hand. \u201cThere is no need for that. I have no intention of keeping this up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d I asked, keeping my gaze as harsh as nails. My fingers curled around my blade\u2019s loyal grip. I knew it was playing with me\u2014I knew the reaper\u2019s words were a trick, but I would never let my guard down.\n\nThe beast chuckled dryly. \u201dYou are unique.\u201d\n\nI glared at the thing, barely avoiding its eyes. It was toying with me and I knew it. Why couldn\u2019t I take advantage? Why couldn\u2019t I just strike now? No, I thought, dismissing the questions. It was smarter than that. It knew I wouldn\u2019t let my guard down, and it wouldn\u2019t let its guard down either. \n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d was the only word I mustered in response.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.\u201d\n\nMy gaze lifted, brows furrowing on my face. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could give you another chance,\u201d it said, the tone of its voice spawning hatred deep in my chest. The beast\u2019s smile all but dropped as the force in its words made one thing abundantly clear.\n\nIt was serious. \n\nMy mind raced, remembering my younger form longing for more time by the sword. Would it really give me another chance? \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d it said, the dark words dragging hope out of my soul.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d I asked.\n\nIts grin returned, more devilish than before. A chill ran down my spine. \u201cYou will have a different body. But you will retain your mind. Life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.\u201d\n\nI considered the offer against my better judgment. The same instincts that were guiding my stance screamed at me to stop. But as I stared at the beast, sunlight dancing on cracked bone, I could find no fault in its intentions.\n\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\nIts grin grew wider. \u201cOne touch\u2014and a new life is yours.\u201d\n\nOvercome by a dark, sudden, inexorable urge, I agreed. As though manipulated by some outside force, the desperation in my mind preyed on my memories and won out over all doubt. The reaper appeared next to me like a shot of ashen lightning.\n\nIts finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip tightened and my mind screamed, but it was already too late. The bleach-white bone touched my skin and my body filled with ice. \n\nMy mind burned. My bones froze. And I experienced the most agonizing second of the rest of my life before everything went black.\n\n---\n\nA jolt of motion startled me up from my slumber. I twisted, feeling only the most distant of pain. Everything was numb. A cold, unfamiliar haze was draped over my mind. I stared into the black, faintly wishing for the ability to feel again. Unfortunately, my wish was granted in short time.\n\nMy body snapped up. A frigid wind crashed against my face, sending shivers down my spine and a howl through my ears. In a second, everything came back and my mind spun through the images. New mixed with old and familiar with foreign as my mind swirled, but I couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it. I clenched my jaw and waited for it to stop. And yet, as soon as it did, one thought was left, one that forced my lips into a smile. \n\nThe beast hadn\u2019t lied. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I hoped to see my land. I hoped to see my fields, the rows of crops that I was no longer even required to tend. I hoped to see my wife, the beautiful face that just barely escaped me. But the eyes that only vaguely felt like my own were met with a completely different sight. \n\nAll around me, spinning in the wind as if just to mock me for my choices, was a dark forest that I couldn\u2019t recognize. Feeling the horrid cold cut deeper, my smile faded.\n\nI forced myself up, noting soreness in my bones. My muscles were hollow. My arms were shorter. My legs were\u2026 different. Everything about me felt *frail*, as if on the verge of collapse. And as I sat up on whatever rock my body had been strewn across, I felt sharp pain cut a deep pit through my stomach.\n\nMy brain started to spin again, the foreign thoughts, worries, and memories all coming back at once. As the waves passed, they were replaced with regret that was only my own. I shivered, the truth cementing in my mind.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d wanted. It wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d wanted at all. I closed my eyes\u2014if they even were my eyes\u2014and shook my head, trying to force it all away. My efforts were useless as the world set in and one horrible thought echoed out in my head.\n\n*I\u2019d let my guard down.*\n\n---\n\n[Original Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/e8pg0oa/) | [My Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palmerranian)"

    "text": "So I wrote this story a while back in response to the really popular prompt about [soulmates and complementary superpowers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3o7rtq/wp_everybody_in_the_world_has_a_superpower_that/) I'd like to pick up on my writing in the new year and maybe some feedback will inspire me to post what I write more.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I never thought I'd get so big a response. I'm glad so many people liked it! \n\nEDIT 2: Oh my! A legitimate gilding! Thank you so much kind stranger!\n\nEDIT 3: You guys are awesome. I've officially set up a subreddit. Link at the bottom of the story. \n\n*****\n\nI would\u2019ve settled for a boring superpower. 20/20 vision. Perfect pitch. The ability to draw a perfect circle 100% of the time. Or no power at all even. No-shows actually get non-ability checks from the government now since they passed that law six months ago. No powers would have been better than what I wound up with.\n\nI walk into the diner at 8:45. The last rays of the sinking sun temporarily warming the chill evening air. I usually go out as late as possible to minimize the number of people I run into. At this hour, there are only three patrons: a middle aged man sitting at the counter and a couple at a booth. A pair of bells above the door ring as it shuts behind me. \n\n\u201cCome on in, have a seat!\u201d I hear someone call out from the kitchen. \u201cBe right with ya!\u201d\n\nI take a seat at the far end of the restaurant. It\u2019s been five years since I discovered what my power was. It possibly started to manifest sooner but there\u2019s no way of telling when. Most people get them in their teens, around puberty. Some kids take to their powers immediately, some develop them slowly over time. Some are late bloomers, and a rare few just never get any. \n\nJust like with puberty, it can be an awkward time. A friend of mine found out she could fly when she shot over the school on track and field day. Another kid I knew hit a baseball into orbit at a little league game. Destroyed a $70,000 solar panel on the ISS. That one made the news. You learn to control it more or less, but nobody really gets a hang of their powers until they meet the one.\n\nThe scientists don\u2019t know how to explain it, but they think it\u2019s a hormonal thing. They still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the relationship that stabilizes the powers or the sudden improvement or amplification of both powers that solidifies the bond. But my friend found a guy who could control air currents. Turns out he could never generate enough lift to take off, but together she can lift him and he can whisk them along. They\u2019ve been married for two years now. The guy with super strength kept hurting himself from constantly breaking things with his ability. During one of his extended stays at the hospital, he met a girl there for much the same reason. They knew it was a match made in heaven when they shook hands and didn\u2019t crush each other\u2019s fingers. Together, along with therapy and practice, I hear they\u2019ve stopped tearing doors off hinges and breaking down walls.\n\nI\u2019m brought out of my reminiscing when I hear the couple across the room laughing merrily. There\u2019s a spoon levitating between them. It dips into a dessert on the plate and floats gently over to girl and she takes a bite. They both laugh. He keeps saying things like \u201cso what about this\u2026\u201d and \u201cor how about\u2026\u201d Every time he pauses she giggles again, as if he\u2019s just told a joke. I try not to think about it, but deep down, I secretly know the worst thing about my ability is that I\u2019ll never find someone who I could be with.\n\nJust then, the waitress zips out from the kitchen. I say zips because she\u2019s moving almost too fast to track. She busses a table in one corner of the room, gives the man at the counter his bill, and refills the couple\u2019s coffee cups in ten seconds flat. By the time I register that she\u2019s on her way towards me, it\u2019s too late to call out.\n\nAs soon as she gets within two meters of me, she immediately decelerates to a regular pace. Her shoes skid on the linoleum tiles and she goes sprawling to the ground in front of me with a loud grunt that sounds more surprised than hurt. The menu she was holding flies across the room. Everyone turns to look, startled. I flinch.\n\n\u201cSally? Is everything okay?\u201d I see a cook poke his head out of the kitchen. \u201cWhat the hell happened?!\u201d\n\nI was out of my seat and helping her up about two seconds after she hit the floor. The man from the counter comes over with the cook.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m alright Harry. I-I guess I tripped.\u201d She winces as she gets to her feet. The skin on her knees and palms is badly scraped.\n\n\u201cTripped?\u201d the chef grunts. \u201cTwo years you been workin\u2019 here and I ain\u2019t never even seen you drop a spoon. You feeling alright hon?\u201d The waitress, Sally, nods. \u201cJesus Sal, look at your hands!\u201d\n\nThe man from the counter clears his throat.\n\n\u201cI believe I can help with that miss. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing a little iodine and some bandages wouldn\u2019t fix doc, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The doctor smiles.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just show you?\u201d He takes her hands gently in his and\u2026 nothing happens. He turns his palms over, looking confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 there\u2019s usually a slight glow\u2026 the wounds should be healing\u2026\u201d He seems understandably troubled.\nThe waitress gives a little gasp. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just me\u2026 just before I fell, I think\u2026 I think my powers just\u2026 stopped working.\u201d She gingerly rubs her wrist. \u201cWhat about you Harry?\u201d The cook thrusts a hand out. Nothing happens. He tries again. Still nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell\u2026 mine was working just a minute ago\u2026 this is weird.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cHow about you buddy?\u201d\n\nAll this time I\u2019ve been shrinking back, my face feeling hot. Now I can\u2019t bring myself to meet their gazes.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 my powers are working just fine, actually\u2026\u201d This is met with confused stares from the other two, but the doctor\u2019s eyes light up.\n\n\u201cAh I see. You\u2019re a null, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I grimace at the term. From across the room, the spoon floating between the two lovebirds clatters noisily to the table. I grit my teeth. This hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the doctor, who looks at the young couple and then back to me. My ears are burning now. I know I\u2019ve technically done nothing wrong, but in a society where not having a superpower is considered a disability, taking them away might as well be a criminal act.\n\nHarry the chef scratches his chin thoughtfully. \u201cI ain\u2019t never heard of that kinda\u2019 power\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry miss\u201d but she shakes her head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you did it on purpose, hey? I guess I ought to be more careful sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of your, ah, talent?\u201d the doctor asks. \n\n\u201cI can usually keep it to about two or three meters\u2026\u201d His eyes dart to the couple and back. \u201cI should probably go\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw, naw, kid, sit down. This I gotta see,\u201d the cook says with a grin. That\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t a paramedic trying to heal a near-fatal injury or a firefighter trying to lift a broken beam off someone this time.\n\nI take a deep breath and sit down. Closing my eyes, I go over the steps like I have a thousand times before. The chef takes a step back, then another. Suddenly, a little flame puffs into life in the middle of his palm. He chuckles. The doctor gently leads the waitress away. A soft white glow shines from his hands. The waitress straightens up. There\u2019s not a scratch on her anymore.\n\n\u201cWow Doc! The pain\u2019s all gone too!\u201d In the blink of an eye she retrieves the discarded menu and zooms back, coming to a careful stop before she gets too close. She walks towards me with exaggerated steps and hands it over. \u201cNo harm, no foul?\u201d She smiles politely. The chef claps me on the shoulder and walks away. The doctor gives me a meaningful smile, tinged with pity.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d With the show over Sally the supersonic waitress takes my order and then whips across the room to the couple. I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, but at one point or another each looks at me. The familiar feeling settles over me. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like, having my power. I couldn\u2019t repel people any more if I had wound up with magnetism instead. Sally whips up with a pot of coffee and a mug, again coming to a halt before walking towards me, pouring and walking away.\n\nThe bell at the door jangles again. A young woman enters. I keep my eyes on the steam rising from the mug. \n\n\u201cTake a seat hon, I\u2019ll be right with ya.\u201d The woman quickly finds a seat by the back, walking between tables. Sally, already back to her old rhythm it seems, goes zooming around to greet the new customer. She procures another cup and speeds over. What happens next only takes moments. In short order, the waitress roughly bumps into the table instead of stopping, fumbling with the pot and accidentally splashing coffee. The woman cries out and Sally immediately apologizes. Without thinking, she sets the pot down and bolts away to get a napkin\u2014shooting right past the counter at twice the usual speed. She careens into a wall with a thwack that sounds significantly more painful than embarrassing and flops onto her back, out cold. There are a few seconds of stunned silence.\n\nHarry pokes his head out from the kitchen: \u201cAgain Sal? How many times are\u2014\u201d he trails off when he sees her unmoving on the floor. \u201cJesus Christ! Sally!\u201d The doctor is already by her side, hands glowing. He stops the chef before he can exit from behind the counter.\n\n\u201cYou need to call an ambulance. Right now. This is beyond my talent to fix alone.\u201d He turns back to the unconscious waitress, face grim. A big gash has opened up on her forehead.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened!?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh God\u2026 I\u2014I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d The woman who walked in is now on her feet, face white as a sheet, hands clasped in front of her mouth. A loud pinging sound interrupts before she can say another word. I turn in the direction of the young couple, who are both sitting mouth agape, staring at the same unfortunate spoon, now embedded in the far wall. Then the girl cries out.\n\n\u201cJane!\u201d This is her date, leaping across to see if she\u2019s okay. The doctor strains his neck trying to see what\u2019s going on. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t know what happened, the spoon, it just\u2014I never\u2026\u201d but she\u2019s not listening. She doesn\u2019t appear hurt. Not physically. Still, she puts her hands over her ears and shrieks.\n\u201cRich, oh God Rich, make it stop! It\u2019s too loud! Too many voices!\u201d The girl collapses out of her seat curling into a ball on the floor. \u201cMake it stop!\u201d she pleads. \u201cPlease make it stop!\u201d\n\nThe boy doesn\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s rubbing her back, trying to help. Silverware, dishes, table settings, all around the diner are starting to rattle.\n\n\u201cWhat the HELL IS GOING ON?!\u201d Harry shouts above the din. Things devolve quickly after that. The glow from the doctor\u2019s hands explodes into a brilliant whiteness. Sally\u2019s eyes snap open and she arches her back with a loud gasp. \n\n\u201cHow\u2026?\u201d that doctor\u2019s eyes widen in alarm. Simultaneously, both of Harry\u2019s hands erupt in flames. \n\n\u201cGAH FUCK!\u201d The bewildered chef starts waving them around wildly, his sleeves catching fire. The girl Jane is still keening on the floor. Rich is crouched by her side, a maelstrom of utensils and tableware starts whirling around the room. Through it all, the young woman is still standing, frozen. Tears of fear and horror pouring down her cheeks. A look I\u2019ve never seen on someone else.\n\nThen it clicks.\n\nI stand up and walk over through all the chaos, until I\u2019m right beside her. I put my hand on her shoulder and turn her to face me. She meets my gaze. Something in my eyes must be speaking to her too, and that\u2019s when I know for sure. I wrap my arms around her and pull her close. She\u2019s soft and small and smells like lavender. I feel hot tears soaking through my shirt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cEverything is going to be okay.\u201d\n\nEverything stops, all at once.\n\nAll the dishes fall to the floor. The blinding light from the doctor\u2019s hands disappears. Harry\u2019s firearms sputter and go out. The room is silent, except for a few whimpers coming from Jane, and the muffled sobbing coming from the woman in my arms. \n\nThe doctor tends to everyone in short order. Sally was fine the moment the flash hit. He says he never had results that fast, even with his partner right next to him. Harry has some light burns, but the doc takes care of those. Besides needing a new shirt and having no more hair on his arms, he\u2019s fine. He grumbles about closing early tonight. Sally agrees. Rich had a cut above the eye where an errant saucer clipped him, and Jane had a small headache, but both are no worse for wear.\n\nHe approaches me wordlessly. There\u2019s a small gash on my forearm I didn\u2019t notice in all the confusion. He holds out his hand to heal it. I start to protest, but before I can say anything, the warm glow appears around his fingers. My arm tingles for a moment and when he pulls away, I see my cut is gone. I\u2019m flabbergasted, but the doctor smiles knowingly. He gives me a nod and a wink and walks away.\n\nI turn my attention to the woman. My soul mate, I realize, and I don\u2019t even know her name yet. I loosen my embrace and she pulls her head away, but her arms are still tightly wrapped around me, and mine around her. She looks blurry. I blink and wipe at my eyes. Her face is red and raw and beautiful. Messy hair and cheeks shiny with tears. The red rimming her eyes makes the blue inside them pop. \n\n\u201cHi\u201d I say. She laughs. A low, soft giggle. I can\u2019t help but laugh a little too.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d She buries her face in my chest and says something else, but I can\u2019t make it out. \n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d she repeats, softly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nCome visit the newly minted /r/IrateCanadien if you want!\n"
