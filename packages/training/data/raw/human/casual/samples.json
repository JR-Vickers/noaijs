    "text": "There is a guy near my cubicle at work who is probably the happiest, most caring person I know from how I have interacted with him since he got hired a month ago. I sat with him a lot to teach him his job and he was assigned to the same team as me.\n\nA lot of people have called him weird and made jokes about him. Even the head of the department has made comments about him while he was in earshot. He is always staying active  he does yoga in the parking lot, and if he is tired on his lunch he we still on his car( not in). Definitely a bit strange but I don't think he deserves to be treated that way for emphasizing physical and mental health.\n\nI am a bit overweight so a week ago I asked him if I could join him and if he could help me excersize. It turns out he has a bachelor's and a masters in exercise science which was super cool. He taught me how to stretch properly and prepare for a run. We then ran and I completed my first mile in under 10 minutes( I know this sucks) and a total of 3.1 miles with stops to stretch and to slow my heart rate down. Running a 5k in segments I did not think possible. He let me set the pace and was super encouraging the entire way. He also explained his freshman year he was overweight as well and someone dragged him out and got him to excersise\n\nOnce we finished he said I should join him again next Friday as that is his \"recovery\" day. I got home and felt amazing. I then check my messages and this guy's has made a custom workout plan for me for the next two weeks with a note saying after I accomplish that he will see where I am and adjust it. He also put in his notes that my short terms goals should be a half marathon and long term should be a marathon. I teared up a little that someone I barely new was willing to put a lot off effort and commit to getting me in shape.\n\nTLDR: The guy everyone was making fun of is now my personal trainer and apparently has the credentials to do that as well.\n\nUpdate: Thanks you so much for the conversation in the comment below and for all those shiny award things! I have not gotten those before. I am surprised this blew up as much as it did. I have been trying to respond to everyone's questions or comments for the past hour or so. I will continue working my way through for a bit more tonight. Otherwise I will try to respond to the rest tomorrow. Also don't be afraid to reach out and be friends with someone even if no one else will give someone a chance! Every one deserves a chance at a friendship. Be like my new friend!\n\nSecond update: I am a guy and I am happily married. After seeing some comments I thought I'd clear that up. I. Just value having good friendships with other guys. Sorry if I crushed anyone's romance stories!\n\nThird update: I do stand up for him as much as I can especially when it's a direct conversation with me. I have a strong \"I don't negotiate with terrorist\" policy on this.\n\nFourth update: apparently running a mile under 10 minutes is something to be proud of. Thank you all for the compliments. Before I put on 60+ lbs in fat I used to do it in under 7. I am out of touch with reality and I am sorry about that! You guys are all awesome BTW.\n\nFifth update: I think I have responded to all the questions. I am overwhelmed by all your comments, encouragement, and advice you guys have given me! I was expected maybe 5 responses but am glad I was able encourage close to 50,000 people. Also thanks for all these awards. I am not sure yet what all of them mean but will look further into them! Have a great Sunday!\n\nSixth update: apparently my supervisor is a reddit user and is now messaging me about it. I already put my two weeks notice in but hoping that it won't be a drama filled two weeks. Wish me luck! If you are reading this sup please don't throw me under the bus!\n\nSeventh update:So it has been a few months since I posted this and I am still getting daily support and messages. Thank you all for your kind words. Life is going very well! The inspiration of my friend has led me to be in a lot better shape. I just finished a 22 mile kayaking trip with my wife today and last weekend I did a 12 mile hike up a mountain. I have more energy now than I have had in years. I am working as a water technician now and doing census on the side which is keeping me busy . So why was just me and my wife? Sadly my friend parted ways with the company and moved to California to work with an organization that provides assistance to firemen. It was really hard to see him go but he is continually living his life to its fullest. I am thankful for the few months I got to hang with him and I hope those out in California both treat him kindly and get to experience the kind of friendship I had with this guy. I guess real life is different than the movies but I hope some day our paths cross again. Hope you all are having an amazing day!"

I\u2019ve  had a lot of bad experiences but this one was one of the ones I actually liked and one I didn\u2019t mind.\n\nI was riding on the train in Beijing, minding my own business and all of a sudden, someone shoves an earphone to my ears from behind. And I was surprised and pissed that this happened. And lots of rude people in China, so you\u2019re always on the edge. I turned around instantly and it\u2019s this teenage girl and she was hyper and very happy to see me it seemed .\nAnd then she says the most unexpected shit ever. \n\nShe says ..         \u201dI like Rap Music\u201d\n\nWow!!!\n\nI was so shocked but not angry. It was just too surprising and something I wasn\u2019t expecting after having earphones shoved on my ears. \n\nAnd I shit you not, the music was not even a black guy....it was fucking EMINEM...\nThe whole thing brought a smile to my face because I knew it was just ignorance and not arrogance and you can\u2019t be mad at ignorance. She wanted to take selfies with me(selfie with a black guy) . I allowed it . We took selfies and we parted ways."

He left a thank-you note on my receipt. It said: \n\n\"Thank you for saving my life. You have no idea how much I think about you and what you did.\" \n\nI honestly wonder if I should initiate conversation. I fear it may harm him.\n\nEdit: I'm going to say hello on Wednesday when I go back. Here's to hoping it works out. I appreciate the advice and kind words.\n\nUpdate: I went back and he was there. We had a short conversation. He was ecstatic that I returned and was glad I was back before he had toreturn to his mother's home to take care of her, for she had Alzheimer's. He was leaving on a flight on Saturday and wasn't going to return. I have his phone number and an email to contact him with. \n\nHe asked me if I made this post. Apparently he is one of us."

    "text": "After 5 years, 2 kids, many jobs, many homes, and many breaks from school, I finally finished my associates degree in business administration from my community college and will start university next year. It\u2019s always been a goal of mine to finish college since I am a first generation high school graduate and now a first generation college graduate :) nobody ever told me to go to college and when I say nobody I mean NOBODY. Not any teachers, relatives, friends, bosses, it\u2019s just something you don\u2019t really push on a poor kid to do since it\u2019s obvious you have to work. I never got support from anyone any time I complained about school and how hard it was to balance everything. Either way I always pushed myself to continue and now that I hit this milestone, the reaction was underwhelming from everyone including my mom and husband but oh well I\u2019m proud of me :) thanks for reading\n\nEDIT: OMG I did not expect all this kindness! I got anxiety when I first made the post that I decided to log off and barely check it right now. You guys have me crying and smiling at the same time! Thank you to each and every person who commented and for all the awards. I\u2019m honestly going to print this post and keep it as an inspiration to finish my bachelors. It\u2019s been such a crazy year I think for all of us and to know that there is still so many kind souls out there, thank you so much. You don\u2019t know how much your words mean to me. And for everyone that is in a similar situation, college is hard and I believe in every one of you! If I was able to do it I know you can do it too \u2764\ufe0f"

    "text": "I (31F) began to lose my hearing about ten years ago, when I was in the military. My husband and I got a cat about five years ago. I've never owned a cat before, so I had no idea what kind of noises they made besides \"meow\" so I had no context for what to expect when I heard my cat purr for the first time today. \n\nI was laying in bed and he jumped up next to me and snuggled into my armpit. I started to feel him vibrate like he always does and then I heard it. I was so scared at first, I didn't understand what the sound was. Then it clicked: purring isn't just vibrating! It's a sound! I can hear it! My cat has wandered off now, but I keep bursting into tears just thinking about his purr. I've never heard a cat purr before and it's so sweet. There's this ethereal quality to it I can't even describe. It has this rhythmic pattern to it. It's all nasally, but low and fluttery. \n\nMy husband and kids are sleeping and I don't want to wake them up, but I'll tell them in the morning. I just wanted to share this joy I'm feeling with someone now.\n\nEdit: I've never used imgur before, but I think I did this right. [Paying my cat tax](https://m.imgur.com/a/3JRXEIb). This is Kipper. Also, my family is awake and they laughed when I told them I can hear him purring. They said he sometimes whistle/snores through his nose too. I can't wait to hear that sound!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for those cute little emoji awards. I know they cost money, so instead of giving a clover or heart eyes to me award to me, please consider using that money to buy a box of Girl Scout cookies if you're in the USA. Due to COVID-19, cookie booths around the country have been cancelled and troops are stuck with thousands of dollars of cookie inventory; individual girls (and their parents or caregivers) are stuck eating the cost. You can donate boxes if you don't want them, but any donation will help Girl Scout troops offset the cost of the excess cookies we're stuck with. Or use that money to tip your server or hospitality staff really well. \n\nAlso, I've been amazed at quite a few sounds I didn't know I was missing. I forgot when you rip paper towels they actually make a rip sound. I heard the fan in the living room. I can hear the clock above my desk ticking. Turns out I have no idea how to whisper. My own voice sounds so strange. Consonants sound strange. The water running in tub when I was giving my toddler a bath last night sounded so loud. I can't wait to hear more!\n\nFinal edit: thanks for the love everyone! I'm glad this made so many people happy, although I really wasn't expecting it to get so popular. Unfortunately, there is one user who is threatening to find me in real life and hurt me because they believe I'm impersonating a veteran to get attention. Normally, I wouldn't let a troll bother me, but because I have kids to think about and they're threatening harm, I'm going to be deleting this account and starting over. No big deal! Stay safe, wash your hands, and thank you again for letting me share this special moment!"

    "text": " So you've become immortal. Perhaps it was an accident involving a few rubber bands, a liquid lunch, and a particle accelerator. It doesn't really matter, it's done now. You now have to spend the rest of your life (*ha*) figuring out what to do with yourself.\n\nAt first you do all the dangerous stuff. Hang gliding, cave diving, crack cocaine, etc. You start stabbing yourself at the local bar as a trick to get free drinks. But you're running out of clean shirts that don't have knife holes in them.\n\nYou briefly dabble with thoughts of becoming a superhero, but crime never seems to just happen in front of you, and going out and looking for it is just so much work you guys!\n\nYou start investing for the long term. You're going to be around forever, what does 5% annual compound interest of $1 look like after 1000 years?\n\nOh god, you're going to live forever. What does that even mean?\n\nYou've got some time to kill, so start a hobby that'll take decades or centuries to finish. Then start a new one. Go to university to study physics and take a few hundred years to discover the quantum-gravitational theory, aka the Universal Theory of Everything. Then master every musical instrument and write a symphony, or 10. Then start doing crossword puzzles. You have time to do it all.\n\nDon't develop close feelings for people. They'll all die, but you'll endure, and funerals are depressing (and for you, unnecessary).\n\nYou can have kids. Lots of kids. But you'll start losing track of them. They only really keep in touch for a few decades. And then they'll have kids and those kids will have kids and eventually you'll lose track of it all. Family doesn't have much meaning anymore once you have a billion or so family members but they all forgot that it was your birthday last Tuesday.\n\nRealize that you'll outlive all of your enemies, you can afford to ignore them and just wait.  Why worry about anything, really. Climate change might make things uncomfortably hot, but you'll endure. The entire banking system may collapse trying to fund the interest on $1 deposited a thousand years ago, but eventually it will recover and you'll be there when it does.\n\nIf you want to, you can rule a country. After all, they can't kill the despotic dictator if the despotic dictator can't die. They can lock you up, but eventually all jails crumble, all regimes change.\n\nYou realize that even your country will fail at some point, and then you'll be right back where you started, bored on a Sunday night wondering what to do with yourself and all this crack cocaine you've surrounded yourself with, and why you didn't remember until just now that it was your birthday last Tuesday and how you didn't get even a single birthday card.\n\nSo forget countries, start up your own religion with you as their god. Call yourself the Undying. Religions last for a long time. The pope held massive power for over a thousand years, kings kneeling before him. You could do that.\n\nFund AI research. Eventually you may want a friend that won't die. Plus you'll start forgetting things. \"Where did I put the bank card to that account I started a thousand years ago?\". The AI can help you keep track of things.\n\nBut keep the self-destruct button close. No one will know you better than your AI companion. But one day you'll have an argument and the AI will try to trap you for all eternity. Or it will go mad and replicate itself infinitely to take over the Earth/universe. You will have to kill it. You will have to kill it and then rebuild it over and over and over again. Remember always to build in a fatal flaw that you can exploit to bring it down. You are immortal, it is your only real competition over time. It is also your only real friend.\n\nThey say that your chances of being trapped in a natural disaster are something like 0.1%. But when your life is eternal, the chances of you being trapped in a disaster becomes 100% over time. It will happen at some point. You may spend a few thousand years trapped in the rubble of an earthquake-toppled building that was built over by succeeding civilizations until eventually archaeologists or erosion or another earthquake frees you.\n\nAt some point you will lose your sanity. It's inevitable. Try spending 10,000 years buried alive in the rubble of an ancient civilization and still keep your sanity. Try to back up your memory (perhaps in that AI that you built)?\n\nEventually, with certainly, you will be alone. In a billion years the sun heats up enough that surface water can no longer exist on Earth, which pretty much means the end of all life.\n\nAll life except you.\n\nIn another 3.5 billion years the sun expands and swallows the Earth. Try not to be there when that happens. Maybe you should use the donations from your religion or the interest on that $1 you invested a thousand years ago to fund space research. If only you could remember the bank account number you deposited the $1 into, or if only the bank still exists and didn't collapse after some ponzi scheme they fell for a few centuries ago.\n\nThe Earth may be gone now, but you're still going strong. The universe goes on and on, for ever and ever, possibly. Eventually the stars start running out of hydrogen and helium to burn and one by one they all snuff out. The universe goes dark then, no more light, but you'll endure. With no more stars, no more radioactive elements will be created. Eventually, every element that can decay will decay down to base iron. With no more heat from stars or radioactive decay everything will cool down to near-absolute zero, which is unimaginably cold, but you'll still feel it. You'll feel it forever.\n\nYou'll still be around. Forever. In the dark. In the cold. Forever. Forever and ever.\n\nHopefully you'll have lost your mind long ago."

    "text": "Unfortunately, my parents took me on a ride on a jet plane when I was a few months old and I had been deaf since then.\n\n\nWe live in a third world country and since my dad worked in the army, we couldn't afford a hearing aid. I didn't have any idea what \"sound\" was. Today, I got a hearing aid as a present from an expat visitor and I could **hear** for the first time in my life.\n\nHe played the song \"We are the world\" by Michael Jackson. It was overwhelming at first but I couldn't help but fall in love with the singer's voice. His voice somehow comforted me. I experienced the peace I never knew existed.\n\nWhat other songs should I listen to?\n\nSorry, I'm all teary after hearing for the first time. I wish I could talk to you guys via voice chat to hear everyone although I'm sure I wouldn't be able to make out what you're saying. I think if people are talking about good things, they would give me that 'good feeling' like the song. I'm not really sure of course. Thanks again!\n\nEdit: I will definitely listen to all the songs recommended by everyone who's awesome to have made a comment and keep each and everyone updated after I've listened to the recommended songs. Wouldn't hurt to try and I'm willing to take whatever the risk haha. So far, I like the less repetitive ones like Bohemian Rhapsody. I find my eyes widen again and again while listening to Bohemian Rhapsody. I knew the lyrics and I thought it was supposed to be a sad song before I was able to hear but when I heard it, it gave more than just sad feelings. It made me feel like I was sort of floating in air. This is actually like a drug. I don't know why. Most of the times I find myself frozen as I listen to the sounds.\n\nEdit 2: Dad and the kind gentleman who gave us the hearing aid showed me how to count the beats. They told me to hit the table along with them when the loudest shortest sound happened and showed me how to dance with the loudest sound. I had no idea dancing to the song would be this fast haha. Now I'm dancing. I thought I was supposed to feel happy while dancing but I feel like I'm riding the waves in the ocean while dancing with the music. It's more than the happy feeling. I feel sleepy and happy at the same time when the music is playing. Is this how it's supposed to feel when you hear the music while you dance?\n\nEdit 3: Holy shit holy shit. I just got back from dancing. I'm listening to all the songs one by one and it just continues to shake my heart. I watched the Equilibrium movie and I always wanted to feel how it must have felt like when I saw Christian Bale in that scene where he heard the music. And I got gold from /u/Subliminal_Image and silver from an anonymous stranger even though I hadn't used Reddit much! Thank you thank you! I listened to Canon In D as recommended by most Redditors and my sister. The music without singers sounds totally different from the ones where the singers sing.\n\nEdit 4: I understand the edits that thank the people who gave gold, silver etc might be frowned upon on Reddit but I just wanted to thank /u/DD2253 for giving me the Pineapple award and the anonymous users who gave me gold and silver awards. I wonder what this award does! :D If I could donate this award to somebody else I'd like to donate it.\n\nEdit 5: I saw the comments which said they wished they could hear the songs they liked for the first time again. No idea why I'm tearing up reading them even after dancing happily with the songs. I am going to listen to all those songs and reply how I felt as I heard them for the first time. Maybe this is the least I could do for the awesome comments. \n\nEdit 6: My brother told me to listen to acapellas which was just the singer singing so that I could separately hear what people sounded like when they sang. It's actually different from symphonies. It's harder to process but it gives similar feelings."

When I asked how he knew about that, he said that my husband is always talking about me and bragging about my cooking and a lot of other stuff that I do.

My go-to meal for the past year was 2kg bags of the cheapest white rice I can find. Nothing fancy. Just carbs and survival.\n\nAnyway, I went to the store the other day, and surprise surprise\u2014all the cheap rice was gone. Like, every brand under 1.50\u20ac completely wiped out. The only thing left was some bougie-looking rice in a brown paper bag with a tiny window that says \u201chand-harvested\u201d and \u201caged for aroma\u201d (like it\u2019s a bottle of wine or something??). It cost 2.79\u20ac, and I sighed while dropping it into my basket like it personally offended my wallet.\n\nI just made it today with my usual cheap stir-fry veggies and soy sauce, and what the heck. It didn\u2019t clump. It fluffed. Each grain was like... separate. It smelled good before I even added anything. The texture was perfect\u2014not mushy, not too firm, just this glorious chewy balance. And even without sauce, it tasted like something. Like actual food. I could feel myself chewing slower just to appreciate it.\n\nNow I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. My mouth is having an identity crisis. What else have I been missing all this time?? Is this what not-poor people eat casually every day?\n\nI hate it here."

They always come back around the same time each day and start making noise outside the window if we forget to feed them. \n\nLast week we found a little pile of coins, mostly pennies, on our back porch near to where we would throw food out.

She was beautiful and everything I wasn\u2019t - cool and confident.\n\nI was one year above her throughout high school, I graduated in 2015 and her in 2016. During my senior year, I made some big plays during a big game and she sort of began warming up to me. After school one day, I walked past she and her boyfriend as they were getting into a huge argument. He was getting into her face and nobody else was around. I could feel something really bad was about to happen so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I walked over to him and told him to back off. Surprisingly, he did (perks to being 6\u20194 and therefore bigger than most guys). He called me some choice words and went on his way.\n\nI asked her if she was okay and she immediately thanked me for interfering. I could tell she was shook up so I offered to give her a ride home, which she accepted. Turns out she lived just down the street from me. She thanked me again and thus began a friendship. She apologized for the way she had treated me, saying she was just playing it up for the other girls and that she had matured beyond that.\n\nLong story short, I eventually confessed my feelings towards her and she admitted that she had developed similar feelings towards me. It was confusing for her because she had never been attracted to another woman before, so it took her some time to accept it. She still claims to this day that I\u2019m the only girl she\u2019s ever had feelings for, all of her celeb crushes are guys and it honestly makes me proud that I was the one able to win her over. We started dating in 2016 and I proposed in February of 2018. We married last September and are currently expecting a daughter together. \n\nLove can be strange, but I\u2019m so glad it turned out the way it did. I\u2019ve only recently started opening up about our story publicly so I hope it can encourage or inspire someone out there \ud83d\ude42"

    "text": "I\u2019m going to try to make this short:\n\nMy ex-wife and I were married for seven years. We had three children. We got divorced over nine years ago. The first year was rough\u2014like any divorce. Both of us had to find our place in the world. We never used the kids as a weapon, and both of us made sure equal custody was never in danger. So, things were amicable. \n\nWe have an autistic son. His behavior in school and at home became so awful that we blamed ourselves. Our relationship got better because we were trying to figure out where we were going wrong. Her husband and I had multiple theories, but she knew the source was school. She hid an old iPhone in his backpack and recorded audio from the day. Short version: he was hit multiple times and tormented by a teacher\u2019s aide all day. \n\nWe went to war with the school. There were a lot of late nights trying to determine what to do. This was five years ago. \n\nFive years ago, she also had a baby with her husband. Her husband came to my house soon after and said, \u201cIt must have been tough seeing a guy move in with your kids. I don\u2019t think I understood that until I had my own kid. \n\nLast year, they asked me to be their child\u2019s godfather. \n\nThe most common reaction to this\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a mechanic and takes care of my car. We\u2019re both musicians, so we play together often. I keep their kiddo for them whenever he doesn\u2019t want to be separated from his siblings. Etc., etc., etc. \n\nThat\u2019s the basic rundown of our relationship over the last nine years. \n\n\nI was very fortunate to get a side gig this summer that pays very well. My kids have never been on vacation. My ex-wife\u2019s husband have never been on a plane. None of them have ever left the country. So I bought tickets for everyone to Rome the week of Christmas.\n\nEDIT: \n\n1. I will post the entire deal with my son soon. \n2. Thanks for the positivity in the comments.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nThere is no romantic involvement between my ex and I. I have been in a relationship for a year.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nI get it! I am a \u201cLOW IQ N***** CUCK\u201d \n\nSay it all you want in the comments, but I\u2019ve seriously deleted over 20 PMs from these pathetic losers.\n\n[My Son\u2019s Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/cenc00/my_autistic_son_was_abused_by_a_teachers_aide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)"

    "text": "ISOLATE AND SOCIAL DISTANCE FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE\n\nMy family has been pestering me to travel out of state to visit for MONTHS. I said no each time because my state has been shit about containing the pandemic and I always say \u201cact in such a way that if everyone did so, everything would work out\u201d. \n\nSelf-quarantining sucks. I wanna go to the beach, I wanna see my family and friends, I wanna see a movie. I still said no, I still got sick. My mom is immunocompromised and I had no idea I was sick. Had I visited last week I would be filled to the brim with guilt right now. \n\nI was completely asymptomatic when I woke up. Then my chest felt tight, then I developed a cough, then my body started aching, my head is pounding, and my stomach is a war zone. All within around 5 hours. I\u2019m currently sitting in the ER because I can\u2019t walk 20 feet without feeling winded. \n\nStay home. Follow guidelines. Keep everyone safe. And if we\u2019re lucky, we can make it through this. But it only takes one overestimate of your health to spiral out of control. Please.\n\nEDIT1: A lot of people have been asking for updates so I just wanna say thank you to everyone for their kind words of support and encouragement. I just got discharged after having the swab stuck up my nose and now I\u2019m home settling in for a long rest. \n\nI posted this basically in real time, and I want to make it clear: even if I don\u2019t test positive for this specific virus, I still contracted *something* despite following CDC guidelines as best I could. No parties, minimal shopping, etc. I\u2019m not even sure how I got whatever is making me miserable right now. What I\u2019m grateful for is that wearing a mask and keeping my hands clean definitely stopped the spread of whatever I have, COVID-19 or not. \n\nI live in a state slammed by the pandemic, so the test will take 3-5 days to come back. I can\u2019t respond individually to everyone, but I wish you all the best and I hope you stay safe."

I have heard her fart in her sleep before and she would get embarrassed if I mentioned it, so I usually shut up about it. I mean, it's just farts. But we've been quarantined with our 4 kids for weeks now and it's... it's a lot. A few hours ago we were sitting on the couch, drinking our coffee and she just let it out. There was a moment of silence followed by a look of defeat in her eyes and a simple \"sorry.\"\n\nI'm so happy. It's just a fart, it's weird but it was such a liberating, humorous moment for the two of us and it made my day."

I don\u2019t know what all the karma does, but thank you for all the generous awards. \nI tried to reply to as many comments as I could, especially ones sharing their own experiences. Let\u2019s beat the shit out of depression. Today I cleaned all of my makeup brushes. Biggest accomplishment of the new year.\nThank you everyone for reminding me that I\u2019m not alone if I don\u2019t want to be. \n\nI lost my freelance job on Monday and am not healthy enough to hold down a full time job. I have been planning suicide for years, and have collected all of the methods. Tuesday, wrote a suicide note, letters to family, the whole schtick. 8PM was when I was going to end it, but I decided to call the suicide hotline at 7. The hotline kept me alive bu calling me every hour. Two days later, I woke up, ate breakfast, cleaned my house (even did laundry), threw out the trash, lit my favorite candle, did a quick exercise and have my favorite cake baking in the oven right now. I\u2019m pretty f**king proud of myself. My next step will be to throw out the medication I was going to take and burn/rip/trash the suicide notes and letters. Hopefully I\u2019ll get there soon, but I\u2019m going to let myself take things slow.\nFor anyone depressed or suicidal; you\u2019re not crazy, you\u2019re in pain. If it\u2019s difficult to reach out for help, try calling a suicide hotline even if it\u2019s to talk to another human before you end your life. They will be kind and they will take care of you.\n\nHere\u2019s the cat tax haha \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/f794j7/day_after_i_almost_committed_suicide_my_cat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"

    "text": "My wife (34) and I (33) have only been married for a year but together almost 5 years. We attended a friend\u2019s wedding where I knew I would see my ex, whom I dated for 7 years and hadn\u2019t seen in 7 years either. \n\nI was nervous, not because I thought things would go bad, but just because it\u2019s been a long time and it\u2019s just awkward and you make all of these scenarios up in your head, not knowing how it will go. This girl, my ex, was once my best friend, even prior to dating, and our breakup sort of divided our whole friend group. I have always wanted nothing more than to all be in the same room again, just being friends. \n\nWe had a similar situation early on when my wife and I started dating, when we went to a wedding and ran into her very recent ex. I think everything was just too fresh and I did not handle it very well, or really any of us. I\u2019ve regretted the way I reacted ever since and always wish I could do it over, especially knowing how I feel about seeing my ex. My wife knows this, as we\u2019ve had many talks about it, and of course she understands.\n\nAnyway, I noticed my ex alone at a table and figured it was my opportunity and dragged my wife along for the ride. We made eye contact and smiled and immediately hugged. I introduced her to my wife and they began talking for a bit. We picked up right where we left off, talking about everything we\u2019ve been up to, catching up on where we were living, and making fun of the groom who was a mutual best friend of ours. \n\nThe night continued and we caught each other in passing a few times. All the stress and anxiety went away. It felt like how I wanted it to feel. Like we were still friends and hanging out like we once did with the groom many years ago. We even all took a photo together. My wife, being the awesome person she is, shamelessly shared it on social media. My friends couldn\u2019t believe we were all hanging out. My wife never said anything bad about my ex nor did she make any jokes about how well it went compared to when we saw her ex, which she had every right to!\n\nOn the way home, I just couldn\u2019t stop staring at my wife. I had this overwhelming feeling of love just pouring over me. I just kept getting the, \u201cwhat are you looking at?\u201d question lol. I truly felt closer to her and honestly looked up to her. I want to be like her. And she\u2019s everything I have ever wanted. I hope that I get a second chance and could do the same for her. \n\nI write this several days later, feelings just as strong, flowers and chocolate in hand, while I wait for her to get home. Love you babe. \n\n\n\nedit: wow, the typical, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this to blow up!\u201d Thanks everyone! To clarify, I am not looking for a continuous relationship with ex, nor am I stuck in the past, its nice to move on and things to feel normal. It\u2019s more that I f\u2019ed up in the exact same situation previously, wife did not use that as an opportunity to do the same. She handled it better than most would. "

    "text": "My husband and I have a good relationship, and I am close with his family. He is a huge momma's boy,  but in a healthy way.\n\nLike everyone, my husband sometimes goes through spells where he has a bad couple of days and needs some cheering up. When this happens, most of the time I can help him through it, but occasionally he just needs some extra support.\n\nHe's been experiencing one of these spells recently. It happened because of some things involving his hometown, and after a day I realized that he needed to talk to someone else, especially since I don't know most of the people involved.\n\nAs I have for the last few years, I text my mother in law to let her know that he was having a rough time and could use a phone call. After I got home from work today, my husband and I were relaxing on the couch watching TV when I heard his phone ring. His voice immediately perked up and I heard him chatting happily, then a little more reserved as he asked her for advice about the situation.\n\nAfter a while, my husband came back into the living room and said something along the lines of, \"Wow. That was Mom. She always seems to know when I'm upset, and just what to say.\"\n\nIt makes me so happy to know that my mother in law and I conspiring together to cheer him up actually works. Watching him go from feeling down in the dumps to loved and protected is the absolute best feeling.\n\nIf your cup is full enough, don't forget to go the extra mile to help someone today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: You guys, I had no idea this was going to blow up. Thanks so much for the kind comments and awards! You are all so incredible. My heart is very full as I type this.\n\nOne thing I didn't mention but I think is important is that I have a very strained relationship with my mother/family. I wish I could call her and get that love and support. I was a little jealous at first, but knowing that including my husband's family makes him happy made it easy to get over. \n\nMy mother in law is an incredible woman. I love her very much and am very grateful to have her in my life, and even more grateful that she and my father in law taught my husband how to be an amazing man. They deserve much of the credit!"

    "text": "Also: \nI am a woman \n\nI am black woman\n\nI am a middle aged black woman \n\n\nIn all these years I can count on one hand the number of times I've revealed all three of these at once. Revealing each one individually already has the propensity to bring the worst Redditors to the table. I can't begin to tell you the names I've been called or the hurtful stereotypes I was expected to defend or debate because I revealed my gender, race or age over the past decade on Reddit. \n\nBut I never engage with those seeking to attack or debate due to the reveal..as wasting my time fighting a faceless battle on the internet with some jackwagon that feels powerful because they are able to hide behind their keyboard is pretty stupid to me!\n\nBut don't get me wrong.. the past decade on Reddit hasn't been all bad. Not way! I developed a phenomenal friendship offline with a Redditor in my city after selling concert tickets to her .. she's now one of my dearest friends.  \n\nAlso, I live in this city without my family. Several years ago I found myself in an abusive relationship during a pretty low, lonely and emotionally trying period of my life. I was an emotional zombie due to the sudden death of my mother and the professional struggles I encountered while trying to stabilize myself professionally and assimilate to a (less diverse) new city where I knew no one. After many doors being slammed in my face professionally, being alone, I gave up on myself and invited the wrong man into my life, putting myself in a worse situation. \n\nLong story short.. Something in me finally clicked and I gained the strength to walk out. (The previous week, I'd been in the hospital as I'd \"fallen\" down a flight of stairs). The firefighters that showed up knew something was wrong but I was afraid to tell them what was going on and what had happened. Yeah, he pushed me. \n\nBut on this night, I grabbed my little dog, my car keys and my wallet..got into my car and sped away. I had no plan. For some reason, that night I posted on Reddit..scared, tired, confused, emotionally drained and broken. Several Redditors in my area came to my rescue..both men and women, offering me lodging for the night, to come and meet me for coffee, numbers to community resources and more, so much help. I rented a room at a Motel 6.. and met a Redditor for coffee, she chatted with me until the sun came up and continued to check in on me the following day. I moved one week later into the very comfortable home of friend of hers that needed a roommate. I had no job at the time, I was on unemployment and had a severance from the company that had laid me off previously (that was quickly dwindling as I'd turned to alcohol after my mothers death). \n\nI found new employment soon after moving in with her and I know the patience, trust and the offer of a stable home and safe space I so desperately needed during that dark phase of my life was the springboard I needed to believe in myself again and get back to the life I deserved to live. The kindness will never ever be forgotten as long as I live as I shudder when I think of where I could have ended up as the depression, alcoholism and bad choices had me in their grasp. \n\n7 years later.. my life is drastically different. I am back on the path of living the quality life I lived prior to moms death. I am stable, financially and mentally. I've a phenomenal career and want for absolutely nothing. But man oh man, that was a bad night, I was on a horrible path and those Redditors were there for me. No judgement, just a desire to help in any way they could. \n\nSo while Reddit has changed a lot over the past decade, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are still Redditors on this site that truly care about their fellow human beings that Reddit alongside them. I guess thats why after a decade... this feisty middle aged chocolate girl (that doesn't look a day over 25.. I promise.. ha ha) is still happily Redditing. :-) \n\nIt's been an interesting 10 years... wonder what the next 10 will be like? \n\nThanks for reading my little ramble.. \nAloha and Thanks Reddit. \n\n\nUPDATE:  Holy guacamole guys.. Thank you so much for all the love and the beautiful comments. And I've been gilded??? I can't even right now. I'm so emotional right now y'all.., dammit Reddit is the tits! Y'all are some cool people out there. Keep on being awesome!!!  \n\nAnd thank you for making my 10th Reddit Bday so damned memorable. "

Today i woke up in my boyfriend\u2019s arms who loves me very much. Today i woke up to see my dog peacefully asleep on our bed. Today i have a decent paying job doing what i love. Today i have my own condo. Today despite the pandemic and craziness happening out there, i enjoy life and the unconditional love from my dog (and of course my boyfriend). It will get better if you fight for it, so keep it going :)\n\nEdit: Holy macaroni! Thank you so very much for all the kind words y\u2019all. I don\u2019t think i had ever had this many birthday wishes. Thank you!! Keep on pushing. You will get through it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit2: Alright folks, you have convinced me that humanity is still genuine and gracious. Please keep spreading love and hope. Many of us will and still need it to keep on fighting and surviving. All the best wishes to all of y\u2019all.

Reddit, in 20 hrs, you\u2019ve taught me love and inspired me to keep on inspiring because i am the lucky one that pulled through hardships. Please keep on pushing and shining your light even in the smallest. You never know who you\u2019d touch. Keep being kind. Keep pushing, you will get through it. \n\nUpdate: I am from Indonesia. I do keep tabs of my parents. I know where they live and how things are. We don\u2019t have family dinners or plan vacations together, but i know that they are well, and they also know where i live and know of my current life. Never admit their faults or recognize my successes. For work, I\u2019m an industrial engineer at a food and beverages company."

My next charge was supposed to be $50+ a month. I had the $11.99 package. \n\nI caught it and fixed everything. So good going, 5th guy. You ruined free Hulu with no ads for 4 other people because you got greedy. And shout out to the hackers of my account who didn't change anything of mine for a few months. Just because you're a \"bad\" guy doesn't mean you have to be a bad guy. To the guy who was watching Daria on it, sorry you couldn't finish. I saw how far you were getting the entire time. To the guy who had the device \"andy's iphone,\" maybe change the name of your device because I think I know what your first name is. But anyway, you're a cool guy. To the 5th guy, you're a moron. You got too greedy too quick. Fuck you. You shoulda just used me to watch Hulu without the live tv thing.

They also were not very well educated on how important dental health was considering the way they grew up.\n\nI do not blame them for it. They didn't know much better.\n\nAll of my teeth were either broken, decaying, or both.\n\nI was very self conscious about my smile and I never wanted to talk to anybody. \nI also never had the funds to afford much dental work so for years, I have been suffering. I couldn't eat properly, I had nights where I couldn't sleep because if tooth pain, and I was just all around miserable. I had constant toothaches and abscesses. It was hell.\n\nAs my dentist was pulling my teeth yesterday, she told me almost every single tooth I had was abscessed. Every one was infected and she told me she was sorry because I had to be in pain. She said I was one tough woman because most people she knows with even one abscess is in excruciating pain and I was walking around like nothing was wrong with more than 15 abscesses.\n\nI told her it was an every day thing for me so it was really all I knew. I didn't know a life without mouth pain.\n\nIt's the day after, my gums are very swollen, they're sore, talking and eating is really weird, but I am so happy for it.\n\nI'm happy to have the soreness and the forced soft food diet and the strange sensation of closing my jaw more than it should because I know this is the beginning of a better, happier, healthier me.\n\nI get my dentures on a few months and that'll be a new adventure in itself.\n\nI'm just so happy.

    "text": "My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i\u2019d go do my homework at the bar, i\u2019d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room \u2014 it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It\u2019s been my family\u2019s livelihood for my entire existence. It\u2019s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It\u2019s my father\u2019s lifelong work and it\u2019s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don\u2019t know who i\u2019d be without this restaurant. It\u2019s shaped me in ways that i couldn\u2019t possibly explain over a reddit post. It\u2019s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i\u2019ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i\u2019ve been so lucky to work with for so long. \n\nI started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn\u2019t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I\u2019m 24 now and i\u2019ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It\u2019s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing \u2014 just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. \n\nTonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it\u2019s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we\u2019ve been open with limited occupancy, we\u2019re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it\u2019s time. My parents are in their 60\u2019s. My dad can\u2019t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn\u2019t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don\u2019t blame them. \n\nI\u2019m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don\u2019t know what the future holds for me, but i don\u2019t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there\u2019s not much keeping me in our town so in October i\u2019m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It\u2019s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I\u2019ve just never known anything else. \n\nI thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. \n\nPlease continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.\n\nEDIT: the response from this has been absolutely INCREDIBLE. thank you so much for this amazing outpour of love. the shift just ended. i\u2019m sitting in the office alone and thinking about it all, reading these amazing messages from people all across the globe. you\u2019re all wonderful and if it\u2019s any consolation, you\u2019ve made my heart feel so warm. i feel a bit in shock and ready to drink some tequila and enjoy the rest of the night with my coworkers in true restaurant fashion. i\u2019m going to try to respond to all of you in due time. thank you so much. \n\n2. since this blew up i thought i\u2019d shoot my shot and say i\u2019m planning on moving to Pittsburgh in october. i don\u2019t have a job lined up so if anyone has any openings, let me know! i\u2019m a hard worker and terrified to move with no plans. i just know it\u2019s time to get out of South Carolina. also if you live in pittsburgh and are looking for a new friend, also message me! i don\u2019t know anyone there and would love to meet some of you Yinzers.\n\n3. a lot of people saying they don\u2019t understand how we don\u2019t have enough money to stay open after 30 years. you need to understand that my parents are old. they do have money put aside. but we moved into a newer, bigger location 5 years ago and our asshole landlord doubled the rent 2 years ago. my parents have been putting money from their own pockets into the restaurant for the last year or so. they could keep it up for a few more years, sure. but then they\u2019d lose all their retirement money. the future of restaurants, especially fine dining, is very uncertain right now. my parents would rather retire now and be able to live off their profits for a few years, than put all their remaining money into it for the next 5-10 years and then have nothing. it\u2019s clearly a big decision we\u2019ve been going back and forth on for the past few months. we came to this decision. i respect them for pulling out now at the end of our 5 year lease instead of risking it all. they deserve this. they deserve retirement. it\u2019s time for them to rest and enjoy their time together.\n\n4. so many people are asking why a random place like pittsburgh. i don\u2019t know. i\u2019ve been obsessed with PGH since i was in early highschool and just haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head. i like the bridges. i like the neighborhoods. i like the hills. i like the parks. and the cobblestone roads. PNC park is the most beautiful ballpark in the country. i love the pride pittsburghers have for their city (something that i never quite felt from the town i grew up in, regardless of the restaurant). i think it\u2019s the most beautiful city in the united states. my favourite artist in the world, mac miller, is from there. it\u2019s a city but it\u2019s not this huge sprawling metropolis like chicago, or NYC, or philly, or LA. i want to be cold. i want to meet strangers with funny accents and have them show me the secret spots in the city. i want to fall in love with pittsburgh like how the people who have lived there their whole lives love it. why not pittsburgh? it seems like the perfect place for me. \n\npittsburgh people, keep messaging me!"

I\u2019ve managed to get past my initial panic to remember how big of a deal my first \u201cboyfriend\u201d was. \n\nI\u2019ve decided to not be too overbearing, as my reaction to her first relationship is going to shape how she talks to me about future ones. I don\u2019t want her to feel like she can\u2019t talk to me, so I\u2019m supportive and casually curious when I talk to her about it. \n\nSo far, it\u2019s all goo-goo eyes and butterflies. \n\nShe introduced me to him a couple nights ago, though sort of by accident. He saw us at the local grocery store and came up to say hi. She turned red as could be and covered her face, so afraid that I was going to interrogate or yell at the kid. I shook his hand and introduced myself. He was super polite and seemed really nice. My favorite thing was him turning back to her to tell her \u201cTold you it wasn\u2019t going to be that bad.\u201d I\u2019m not gonna lie, I laughed at that. \n\nShe came home today after spending some time walking around our little town with him and she just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. She even asked me \u201cHave you ever felt so happy you could just burst?\u201d when she got home before practically skipping to her room. \n\nPuppy love is just the cutest thing.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the wholesome award and silver, lovely strangers!\n\nEdit 2: And thanks for the Platinum! \nYou all have been beyond words!\n\nEdit 3: And more thanks for the Gold and all the other awards.

Today I had a delivery three kilometers away from the restaurant which may not seem like a long way, but it really is in this hot weather. \n\nAnyway, I arrived to the adress, and as soon as I came, the girl who ordered the food came out with a crispy glass of cold water and told me that she had seen me on the bicycle and thought I'd like some water. \n\nHonestly, this may not be such an interesting story, but it was one of the most wholesome experiences I've had in my life. Today was a bit rough for me and this girl absolutely made my day. If you're reading this, thank you so much, water girl! My faith in humanity is restored.\n\nWhat made your day today?"

He soon got his results and there was nothing out of the ordinary as it said he descended from Germanic and Middle Eastern bloodlines.\n\nA few more weeks pass and all of a sudden he gets a call out of the blue. The man over the phone excitedly identifies himself as one a reasercher at 23 and me. He tells my neighbor that his genome is one of the most closely related to Neanderthals in the world that they know of. Apparently the average is some where between 1-2% while his came out as well in the 4%s. They want to bring him for interviews and to do further research on him. He thinks it's absolutely hilarious, does caveman talk constantly now, refers to lucy as his aunt, and has a Fred Flintsone painting on his wall as it's \"Part of my cultural heritage.\" His wife is less amused."

Some of my coworkers who knew had previously almost spilled the beans in front of our boss. \n\nSo I Skyped my boss today, and long story short I told him that I was lesbian, and that my wife and I were recently married. He looked kind of disappointed, and said something along the lines of \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t have you on the team if you are this way. I wish you luck for the future, but I think it\u2019s time you find yourself another job\u2019. \n\nI was a fifth grade teacher and I was very fond of my students, I hope that they get another teacher who will be suitable. \n\nAlso just for some background, where I live gay marriage is legal but not widely accepted. My country is mostly catholic.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, this was something I decided to do because it was affecting us in other ways. I was sick of not being able to invite my partner to events and the like. Was it a mistake? I guess so. I just kind of hope that if I take action about this it can be a way to get people talking about it. I love living in Guatemala, but I\u2019m desperate for members of the lgbtq+ community to have more rights here.\n\nEdit 2: I am from Guatemala\n\nEdit 3: thanks so much for all the kind words and advice. It is so appreciated. I will try and update on this as much as I can without compromising my privacy.\n\nEdit 4: I didn\u2019t Skype him specifically to tell him this, he always meets with most of the teachers in the team every week so I decided to tell him then."

    "text": "I am a 35-year-old loser.\n\nI never went to college for fear of being in debt.  I never got married for fear of being left.  I never pursued a dream for fear of not making it come true.  I've never owned a home.   I have no friends.  I have no family.  I really have no noteworthy accomplishments to date.  What this year has taught me, though, changed everything.\n\nI've been lurking on Reddit for years now (I'm addicted, I admit).  I've read some great stories here, so I wanted to share my journey this year with the rest of you.  If this inspires (or amuses) at least one person then I feel it was worth sharing.\n\nThis year began by me pretty much jinxing the entire year for myself.  I remember saying \"There's no way this year can be worse than last year.\" to a co-worker of mine.  I'm not really superstitious, but I can't help but laugh at the irony.  Anyway, around February I started developing some pretty bad health issues, including an ER visit.  The illness was pretty disruptive to my life, making it difficult to enjoy pretty much anything.  On top of that, I received yet another insulting pay raise at my job of 8 years despite all the hard work and overtime I put in over the previous year.   My company just held a meeting where the leadership was bragging about record growth... yeah...\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure I've got cancer, I'm being taken advantage of at my job, and I have nobody in my life to turn to.  I'm just tired.  No, I'm tired of being tired.  So, I slog through each day without hope.  I drag my feet to the doctor's appointments and zone out while they talk.  I had really given up.\n\nEventually, I had an operation to see what's going on.  Afterward, I'm diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia in my stomach and Barrett's Esophagus disease.    I'M NOT DYING!  It still sucks, but man,  it was like a light switch in my brain.  It was like the realization that life wasn't over forced me to see the potential of what my life could be.\n\nAt the moment, I'm working on IT certs online and planning on moving to NYC soon (currently live in the Southwest US).  I know it's not a perfect place, but it was always my dream to live there.   I don't know where I'll live, or work, but for some reason, I just know I'll figure it out.  I know who I am and what I'm capable of.  I know how to treat people.   I know what I want.   I never took risks in life because I was always terrified of failure, of what could go wrong, and I just don't care about that anymore.  This year has taught me that we only have this one life and we can't waste it.\n\nI have an awful lot of work ahead of me.  I'll have to really put myself out there to find the person I want to be with and to get the things I want out of life.   I'll be competing with people smarter, younger, and more accomplished than myself to establish the career I want.  Things will go wrong.  I will fail.  I will learn.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Good lord, I go eat dinner and come back to a ton of positive responses.  Thank you so much, everyone, it really means a lot!\n\nEdit 2: Well, this post keeps blowing up and I couldn't be more touched.  My inbox is overflowing and I hope to respond to and read as many people's messages as I can over the next few days.  Also, I can't wait to update you guys within the next couple of months."

I tried in the first December graduation but they didn't let me in. I tried again in ~~May~~ June and got in. Finessing your way into the ceremony in ~~May~~ June is super easy. It's so large that if you come 15 minutes late - wearing a suit and looking annoyed - nobody asks any questions, nobody checks your ticket, nothing. I switch seats regularly just to shake things up. I hate sitting still for the 3 hour ceremony but I think it makes them feel better so why not?\n\nSo far I've been to 4.\n\n*Edit:* Wrong month. Not May, June."

(How terrible that people take things that aren\u2019t theirs.) I also thought that was incredibly nice of the staff because they also could have kept it if no one claimed it. I really wanted the person who lost it to find it (I know that feeling, and it sucks). But it also crossed my mind that it would be nice if no one claimed it because $100 would be ridiculously helpful for me right now. \n\nBest part of the story: about 3 hours later I got a voicemail from the owner of the $100 (the hotel must have given it to them) thanking me for turning it in and a story about their situation and how much of a difference finding the $100 bill made.\n\nHonestly, that voicemail was worth way more than $100 to me.

    "text": "I know a lot of people get excited about their birthday but I just don\u2019t see the big deal. It\u2019s not anything I accomplished, it\u2019s just the day I was born. I\u2019m not trying to hate on anyone who does like to celebrate theirs. I mean my wife loves celebrating hers, mine, and our sons. I just never get excited about mine. Was just curious if any others felt the same?\n\nEdit: first off, thanks for the birthday wishes everyone. \n\nThis post wasn\u2019t really to draw attention, it was more about my apathy towards my birthday. I woke up this morning and it just felt like any other day. So I thought why not see if others feel this way. I quickly realized that a lot of people do for a lot of different reasons. I also realized through reading many comments that I have a lot to be thankful for in having people that genuinely care about me not just on my birthday but everyday. I know not everyone has that and it\u2019s not something to take for granted.\n\nNext to the topic of my title. I know the saying is couldn\u2019t care less and that I didn\u2019t proofread the title and it\u2019s says could. Even in saying they couldn\u2019t care less they have to in so way care or they wouldn\u2019t feel the need to express it. So in fact they have room to care less. So I think could care less is more appropriate. \n\nThank you for the silver award too. It\u2019s my first award. \n\nLastly everyone that shares my birthday, I hope you have the happiest of days today. Everyone else happy belated/early birthday!\n\nThat is all."

    "text": "Back in the mid 90\u2019s when my mom was pregnant with my older brother, she was driving home from the store and stopped at a stop light. When the light turned green, she tried to go forward but the gas pedal didn\u2019t work. Confused, she continues pushing on the pedal until a second later, an 18 wheeler flies through the intersection, running a red light. Had her car worked properly, she would have been pancaked by a massive truck going way over the speed limit. And that\u2019s not even the strangest part of her story. She says from that moment on, her memories diverge from the memories of those close to her. She remembers iconic song lyrics slightly differently from her friends, Bible verses she\u2019s had memorized her whole life she now seems to quote incorrectly, (and she includes this one in her story so I will too. I\u2019m skeptical of the Chinese government here but I also wasn\u2019t born yet) she swears she saw Tank Man at Tiananmen Square get run over on live TV and it was such a crucial memory for her because it was the first time she saw my dad cry. Now, no one she experienced these moments with share the same memories as her. She doesn\u2019t have any idea of the mechanics of it, but she feels that she died that day at the intersection, and was allowed to live on in another timeline or alternate universe where things are very, very similar but still slightly different. \n\nI should mention that she doesn\u2019t believe in the Mandela effect, but she does think that something supernatural happened to her that day so that our family as we know it could exist.

Taking mild pain meds or anti-inflammatories. Vibrating massagers, heating pads, ice packs. All of it, but it never really did much for me. \n\nThe other day I stopped at the dollar store for a few odds and ends, when at the checkout was this silly looking object. It\u2019s called a face roller and it\u2019s this little thing that kinda looks like a shrunken paint roller? It\u2019s supposed to relax your face, and that\u2019s what I got it for. It cost 95 cents, what did I have to lose? \n\nIt worked alright on my face, loosened it a bit but nothing too crazy. Eventually I halfmindedly started rubbing it on my neck. \n\nAnd holy FUCKING CHRIST. I actually felt the knots and pain rolling away, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m actually crying as I write this, I cannot believe my neck feels completely normal right now. I\u2019m going to look online for a nice version of one of these things, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what the non- 85 cent version is like. \n\nI don\u2019t have anyone to tell this too, so just felt like bragging somewhere.

    "text": "This probably has been said before but I feel like I need to reiterate it. The fact that alcohol is pushed into our faces by: making it a cultural norm to celebrate your first drink the day you turn legal age, having excessive amounts of pubs/bars in the middle of town, advertising liquor on magazines, billboards, bathrooms, etc., people bragging about how much they can drink and or talk about how cool it is to be blackout drunk and getting wAsTeD, it\u2019s truly disgusting and I\u2019m disappointed in society for it. I understand that alcohol can be controlled at a mature level but almost all adults cannot control their liquor which leads to alcoholism, family issues, damage to physical and mental health and so much more issues down the road. I\u2019m not going to be on my high horse because I have admittedly drank too much plenty of times and or purposely went over my limit due to my poor drinking choices and the alcohol increases more poor choices. Anyways, I hate myself because it\u2019s been only giving me negative outcomes, never positive. I just wish alcohol wasn\u2019t a norm and it was more of a niche thing, as if it was something that people weren\u2019t talking about how drunk they got on the weekend or how stupid they acted on alcohol."

    "text": "The edit you\u2019ve all been waiting for at the bottom. \n\nI\u2019ve been working as a technician in medical insurance for the last two years. In that amount of time I\u2019ve out performed nearly everyone else. I finished my degree in Communication. I\u2019ve won a handful of low level quality and candor awards. \n\nMy annual review will be completed within the next six hours. Then I will know if I get a raise, a bonus, and other privileges. 60% of technicians fall into the 3/5 point range which is considered where most techs are supposed to be. I told my manager last year I wanted to get a 5 and he told me how hard it was. \n\n4/5 points: 30% of technicians obtain. \n5/5 points: 2% of technicians obtain. \n\nTwo weeks ago he said he is going to fight to get me a 5/5 rating. \n\nIf I get this my bonus will be larger than the amount of credit card debt I\u2019m in. My raise will be enough for me to afford a car finally. \n\nI would like some good vibes. I\u2019m jumping out of my skin. I don\u2019t want to depend on this money but I really am. This year has financially killed me I\u2019m clawing my way back up but just can\u2019t afford to pay everything off as fast as I need to.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m overwhelmed with support I\u2019m so grateful for all of you! I\u2019m still waiting but bet that I\u2019ll post an update once I know!\n\nEdit 2: meeting got pushed back to 4 CST. If you think you\u2019re bristling with anticipation imagine how I feel!!!\n\nEdit 3: guys it\u2019s only 3:15 CST I don\u2019t know yet and I\u2019m even more anxious! Thank you for all the good you\u2019ve sent my way I\u2019ve still got a bit to go but I will know in about 45 minutes to an hour!\n\nEdit 4: \nGuys I\u2019m crying as I write this. The fact that thousands of people from all over the world took time in their day to give me words of encouragement and support is so amazing. Thank you all. \n\nSo the reason my supervisor pushed my meeting back so far in the day is because his manager tabled the conversation on me. \n\nMy supervisor compiled every kudos, compliment, certificate, award, training document, and project I have worked on this year. His manager wanted to take the time to look through all of what he had so she paused on me and they addressed my other team members first. \n\nHe fought for 45 minutes giving every reason he possibly could to give me all 5 points. His manager was hesitant. They\u2019d only awarded 3 other techs this year so far because of the strict criteria and her guidelines for how to award points. \n\nHe pressed her, pleaded my case, and showed all of the documentation he possibly could to prove I deserved to the rating. And I am so thankful for all that he did. \n\nBut despite all of the efforts he made I still got the news that nearly killed me. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve given you all the same heart attack that he gave me I GOT THE RATING. \n\nI AM ONE OF FOUR TECHNICIANS. \n\nLess than 1% of technicians were awarded all 5 points and I\u2019m one of them! New car and no debt coming this January.\n\nEdit 5: you all are amazing. To answer some FAQ: \n\n1. I plan on buying a used car, I have owned 2 cars in the past and they were both 5 years or older and used. \n\n2. A medical insurance technician processes insurance claims made by patients (I have no control whether the company covers things or not so please don\u2019t blame the tiny screw in the giant cog of fucked up healthcare) \n\n3. I am going to pay off all of my credit card debt first. If the remainder of my bonus is enough for a down payment then yes I\u2019m getting a car I need/want ASAP but if not then I\u2019ll be saving the remainder. \n\n4. I do have a 401k and a retirement plan with Edward Jones."

Aww, man. Not again. But after thinking about it for a bit, I realized he was just being friendly. A small gesture to be pleasant. He didn't know I am a woman. He wasn't trying to insult me. After that it was better.

I made it on a whim, and I have no idea if people want it. \n\nThe idea is to keep this wholesome vibe going (please don't award it, the ones here are quite enough, and thank you again!), and make it a place where everyone is important, and everyone can get a virtual hug when needed. \nI will keep giving out awards here, and at WholesomeHygge, so head over and start Hygging!"

    "text": "When I was 11 or 12 I was working witj my uncle to gut an old building. While driving a maul through a lathe and plaster wall I went deeper than intended and speared my pinky knuckle on a peice of old dirty wood. I pulled the wood out and continued working, thinking nothing of it.\n\nAfter it healed I noticed a greyish black dot there. I showed it to my mom and she said some dirt must have been left behind.\n\nI'm 36 now, for the last 25 or so years I've jokingly referred to my litte black knuckle dot as \"my first tattoo\".\n\nThis morning I was making shelves out of scrap plywood and cut myself a little bit in the same place. While checking the cut I noticed a darker dot deeper. I grabbed a knife and cut a bit deeper, eventually pulling out a ~1mm bit of what is presumably wood.\n\nI'm a bit relieved to have it out, but a bit sad to have removed something that was a constant part of me for 2/3 of my life.\n\nMy wife is completely unimpressed.\n\nEDIT: My uncle just texted me back, the house was built in 1901. The rest of the wood in that wall ended up in the burn pile, but that 1 mm bit completed its century in my hand.\n\nEDIT 2: WOW. This is my most popular post ever! Thank you all for the wonderful conversations. It was interesting hearing about so many people's similar spots, and finding out about r/pencilstabbers (even one on someone's eye!), hearing about other scars like the lawnmower foot, and dozens of glass shards.\n\nI'm off to read some Stormlight Archive for a few hours before bed. Have a good night everyone.\n\nMy wife is much more impressed with ~9000 upvotes than she is for a 120 yr old peice of wood embedded in my hand.\n\nEDIT 3: I woke up to find that it ha blown up more! Wow. Also discovered that in addition to a lot of people being stabbed by pencils, and having thorns or glass embedded in them, there are A LOT of Sanderson fans here!\n\nI'm on my 4th read through of the series, and still picking out odd easter eggs I missed. Hopefully those books get made into a movie so more people can experience it, I'd pit the Cosmere against GoT or LotR any day of the week. It and Malazan are my two favorite series.\n\nEDIT 4: I just finished catching up on all the posts and awards from overnight. If you gave an award and didn't get a thank you it is because reddit was trying to get me to start a chat with you. I don't know your timezone and worried about waking you, so a big Thank You!\n\nEDIT 5: I've never had a post blow up like this before, it has been an interesting experience. There have been so many interesting and very wholesome comments and discussions with almost no negativity. Thank you all! This has been an awesome day, regardless of if I get a tattoo dot to memorialize my splinter this thread and all of you are a better memorial to it than I could ever conceive."

I love how simple and practical they are.\n\nChubby boys, skinny boys, buff boys, tall boys, short boys, white boys, black boys, asian boys, trans boys you name it, they are all cute in their own ways. If you are reading this and you are a boy, you better feel appreciated, because you, my dude you are handsome.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nEdit: I wanna thanks everyone for the comments and messages it's been really sweet, unfortunately I have to sleep but I will keep reading them tomorrow, even if this take me the entire day.\n\nEdit\u00b2: This post keeps getting bigger and bigger, and I'm really glad for it. I'll keep reading the comments and the messages through the day. I don't know if it will eventually become so big that I won't be able, but I'll keep trying.\n\nFinal Edit: So far I think I was able to read all the comments. Unfortunately, I have a pretty shitty data plan, and won't be able to continue. But I want to say that it's been a emotional rollercoaster reading through it. \n\nOverall, I'm really happy and truly glad for all the messages I've got. I hope I was able to answer every single one of them until now. And for the ones that will come, I'll keep answering them when I have the chance.\n\nThanks for the dudes, and also for the girls who shared their opinions about all those beautiful boys.\n\nI hope you all had a great day.\nI wish you all a great year, and a great life.\nBe well, every single one of you."

As I was carrying him past my oldest's door (which is perpetually closed) he asked to see his big brother. I knocked and asked my oldest if he would talk to his baby brother. This aloof, too cool for everything teenager got up and held his baby brother and comforted him, rocking and talking to him until he was calm enough to accept his own bed. In a house, normally full of chaos and bickering, I saw in this small gesture that there is real love between these brothers despite the significant age gap."

    "text": "I got booted in a Jimmy John's parking lot a few months ago. Well, it was the parking lot of a stip mall where you could park about 12 feet from Jimmy John's But the catch is, technically it's not the JJ's property. So the strip mall property owner hires one of those shady boot-n-tow vehicle impounding businesses to circle the lot like sharks and boot anyone who parks there and enters any establishment not technically part of the strip mall. \n\nWhich was me, back in like august. \n\nI picked up a sandwich (freaky fast) and got back to my motorcycle in about 4 minutes, and that asshole had booted me. I was so confused, but he explained that JJ's parking is in an adjacent lot, and this lot was only for the strip mall customers.\n\nI offered to buy a smoothie or something at the strip mall, so I would qualify as one of their customers, but he said it was too late. He saw me walk into JJ's and now I must pay the $80.00 fee to remove the boot. \n\nAfter about an hour of HEATED argument, I had no choice. I paid the guy. $92 lunch. $12 for the sandwich and chips, and $80 for 4 minutes of parking. Motorcycle parking, no less, which takes up basically zero valuable space. \n\nAnyway since then I've done some research and it turns out that's extortion which is illegal. By law, they are required to remove the boot and mail you the bill if you are not able to pay them on the spot. You know why? Because it's not illegal to NOT HAVE 80 DOLLARS. And what would I do if I got that bill in the mail? Idk, maybe I'd pay it. Or maybe I'd set it ablaze and use it to light a fat spliff because FUCK YOU DON'T STEAL MY MONEY. Parking extortionists aren't the law. I'm not paying them a dime. \n\nSo anyway I saw them out booting again at lunch hour, so I figured I'd have a fun time with it. I parked in the JJ's lot, got a hoagie, and walked to the shark lot and waited for people to come out to their booted cars. Then, I interrupted the parking enforcement's whole speech by citing the law which mandates that they unboot the car without payment. \n\nThe parking lot guy was livid. And there was nothing he could do about it. Just like how I was livid and there was nothing I could do about it when he booted me back in August. Fuck that business. Fuck that dopey boot guy and his shitty job and his shitty life. I laughed my ass off at him all afternoon."

I had noticed she had very pretty teeth (I aspire to be an orthodontist) and on one of her stories I complimented her smile. Almost immediately she replied with a response of her smiling from ear to ear, and she thanked me for the compliment. She hadn\u2019t posted herself showing her teeth often when she smiled. \n\nNow whenever I see her post a new picture of herself, she smiles with her teeth showing, and her beautiful smile reminds me of our little encounter and it warms my heart."

So I look over and there are these 2 middle aged maybe older white dudes. The guy driving, said \"sorry ma'am, just wanted to let you know you left your key in the door\". I say, \"oh my gosh, thank you so much\".Then I reach out my window and touch my door. They erupt in laughter  as I realize my key is in the ignition and they speed off into the sun laughing like hyenas.\n\nEdit: after the fact, I don't feel so stupid lol.

We want to have a big ceremony and celebrate with everyone but COVID. We just decided to do it and made the appointment to go to the courthouse. He told me that later we can do a big wedding in Mexico and that he would do it as big as I wanted it. He\u2019s so sweet I love him so much. I can already see my future with this man.

    "text": "Feels bad man.\n\nI mean, I get it: they want a profit. But honestly with the way YouTube Premium is going (or rather not going), all they\u2019ve done is slash the utility of their app without getting that much in return.\n\nIt\u2019s just disappointing is all.\n\nEdit: Perhaps I gave the wrong impression. No, I\u2019m not one of those chumps who actually pays for YouTube, and I never will.\n\nEdit: I am on iOS, not Android, as are a lot of the other people viewing this thread. We all definitely appreciate any solutions or ideas that you provide, but it would also be good to note whether the solutions you propose only work on one or the other.\n\nEdit: 400 other people have already suggested YouTube Vanced. Pls no more. It is Android only, btw.\n\nEdit: I used music just as an example. YT isn\u2019t my primary source for music. I get my music from my streaming service of choice, as do most of y\u2019all I bet. But there are also plenty of other reasons why you wouldn\u2019t need the visual content of a video. Podcasts, Ted talks, whatever else.\n\nEdit: Been busy the last two days. Haven\u2019t had time to read or reply to many comments. I\u2019m back to the party a bit late, but I\u2019ll be replying to some of y\u2019all soon."

    "text": "So, I live in China. Before the COVID thing, in January, my employer gave us a huge amount of groceries (like nuts, oil, rice) for spring festival.\n\nBut I live in a tiny ass apartment without a kitchen, ALONE. So I really don\u2019t need that much food, and I genuinely CANT eat all of them since I\u2019m also a tiny human being. \n\nBefore leaving work that day, I think long and hard about what I should do with all these food. There\u2019s no food banks where I live and I don\u2019t even have a car. Most of my friends are already travelling back home, so I can\u2019t just split them with my friends.\n\nThen, I realized that, there\u2019s a tiny noodle place close to where I work. They\u2019re obviously a family-run business, I sometimes go there for dinner. Not familiar with the owner (never even talked to that guy), but I thought, hey, they need oil and stuff more than I do.\n\nSo, I just went to their place, they were just closing up. There\u2019s no customer. I grabbed the guy cleaning tables, asking if they want the groceries I\u2019m holding. He looked confused and suspicious of me, went in and got the owner to talk to me.\n\nThe owner is actually a very nice older chubby dude. I asked him if he wants my stuff. He mistook my intention and asked how much I want for them. I blushed so hard and stuttered that they were all free. He just went \u201cno no no, I can\u2019t do that, you must have some money.\u201d (He\u2019s Uyghur, so he\u2019s not very good at speaking mandarin).\n\nMe with my red ass face insisted that he keep the groceries for free while he tries SO HARD to give me money. I said:\u201dHappy new year, it\u2019s for you.\u201d And I basically ran out of there yelling HAPPY NEW YEAR.\n\nAnd the COVID thing happened, I met the dude a few days ago after things eased a bit here in China. He was just closing up, again, and he gave me the biggest smile I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nHappiest day in three months."

I\u2019ve reached out to both the local management as well as the corporate offices (Choice Hotels) with a similar message. Still awaiting responses from both, I will update as soon as I hear back. \n\nHopefully we can get Jerry a raise!! You guys are awesome and this thread has been so full of positive stories. Today was a good day.  Thanks for that Jerry. \n\nAlso, the hotel was in Winslow Arizona, don\u2019t see any harm in disclosing that info. And the place was a Quality Inn, not a Comfort Inn. Cheers.\n\nEdit 2: here is The response from corporate:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/RFghx5p\n\nI still need more solid proof Jerry is gonna get his, but this is a solid start. Still no response from the local mgmt."

    "text": "He's adorable! He never ever bakes, and rarely cooks. I am a fairly intermediate baker who's pumped out at least 10 recipes during quarantine. Today, I think purely out of boredom, my sweet husband exclaimed with a big smile, \"those bananas have turned, I think I'm going to bake banana bread by myself!\". So he texted back and forth with his dad (a master banana bread maker) and got a recipe lined up and away he went. I'm outside laying in the sun right now, and he's been popping out every couple minutes to ask where things are or if he should substitute this for that or if he should cut the sugar down... I'm just tickled by the whole thing, I think he's adorable for trying something new and out of his comfort zone. And even more tickled he sees me as some sort of baking expert lol. I love him and he's the cutest.\n\n** *UPDATE!* The hubs came out with his beautiful looking bread fresh out of the oven, it rose perfectly and smells absolutely amazing. I told him to put it on the wire rack to cool. He went back inside to do so, and then popped his head out one last time and said, \"I DID IT!\" in the cutest voice hahaha. Having a proud mom moment.. even though I'm his wife.\n\n** *UPDATE #2!* We're eating it and it's perfect! He knocked it out of the park. [Bread tax](https://imgur.com/a/MJIRIqI)\n\n** UPDATE #3!* Here is the recipe my husband used that his dad passed along to him https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-banana-nut-bread-4584069. It's not my FIL's recipe, just the one he's been using lately! Cheers and happy baking!"
